# Ethics Statement for Psychological Concepts and Quranic Verses Matcher

## Purpose

This document outlines the ethical considerations and guidelines for the Psychological Concepts and Quranic Verses Matcher project, including our approach to web scraping and data usage.

## Ethical Considerations for Web Scraping

1. Respect for Source Material

   - We scraped psychological concepts from https://helpfulprofessor.com/psychological-concepts/, a public blog by Professor Chris Drew.
   - Before scraping, we checked the website's robots.txt file to ensure scraping was permitted. The robots.txt file (https://helpfulprofessor.com/robots.txt) does not disallow scraping of the specific page we used.

2. Fair Use and Attribution

   - We believe our use of the content falls under fair use for educational purposes.
   - We provide clear attribution to the source in our documentation and code comments.
   - The scraped content is used as a starting point for our project and is significantly transformed through our matching process with Quranic verses.

3. Minimal Impact

   - Our scraping script is designed to make minimal requests to the website, reducing server load.
   - We implemented rate limiting in our scraping process to avoid overwhelming the server.

4. Open to Feedback
   - We are open to feedback from the content owner and will promptly address any concerns if contacted.
