Anima and animus,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"According to Jung, these are the male and female archetypes residing in the unconscious of individuals, respectively. The anima exemplifies the feminine principle in men, while the animus signifies the masculine principle in women.",Az-Zumar (39),6,He created you from one soul. Then He made from it its mate...,"This verse highlights the concept of complementary male and female archetypes, symbolizing the anima and animus. It emphasizes the creation of partners for human beings from a single soul."
Archetypes,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"In Jungian psychology, these represent universal, primal, and collective mental representations inherited from our earliest ancestors. They are prevalent in literature, art, and religious iconography across cultures and serve to channel experiences and emotions, resulting in recognizable behavior patterns.",Al-Isra (17),80,And say: My Lord! Cause me to come in with a firm incoming and to go out with a firm outgoing. And give me from Thy presence a sustaining Power.,"While the verse does not explicitly mention archetypes, it emphasizes the need for inner strength and sustenance from the divine power, which relates to the idea of universal and inherited mental representations."
Collective unconscious,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"A term coined by Carl Jung, it posits the existence of a shared part of the unconscious mind among all humans, deriving from ancestral memory. It’s believed to contain archetypes, universal images, patterns, and instincts inherent in all of us.",As-Sajdah (32),7,"Who made good everything that He has created, and He began the creation of man from dust.","This verse highlights Allah's ability to create and perfect all aspects of His creation, including humans. It indirectly alludes to the concept of collective unconscious, suggesting a shared origin and fundamental elements within humanity."
Countertransference,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This refers to a therapist’s emotions and responses to a client, which can stem from the therapist’s own personal history. It’s typically considered as hindrance to therapy but can provide insight into the dynamics of the therapeutic relationship.",Al-An'am (6),50,"Say (O Muhammad): I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor do I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is inspired in me. Say: Are the blind man and the seer equal? Will ye not then take thought?","Although not a direct reference, this verse serves as a reminder that humans are fallible and limited in their knowledge. It encourages introspection and reliance on divine guidance, potentially helping therapists acknowledge their own limitations and biases in countertransference."
Death drive (Thanatos),Psychoanalytic Psychology,This is a compelling concept from Freud that suggests humans possess an inherent drive towards death and self-destruction. It counterbalances Eros (the life drive) and is often associated with aggressive behaviors.,An-Naziat (79),46,"Verily, your Lord is indeed watchful.","This verse reminds believers that Allah is aware and watchful over all things. While not explicitly mentioning the death drive, it is a subtle reminder of the concept that humans are ultimately accountable for their actions, including destructive tendencies."
Defense mechanisms,Psychoanalytic Psychology,These are strategies employed by the ego to mediate the conflict between the id and superego. They are unconscious mental processes that guard the individual from anxiety or unacceptable thoughts and feelings.,Al-Baqarah,286,Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...,"This verse highlights the concept of defense mechanisms by reminding individuals that Allah does not burden them beyond their capabilities. It implies that when faced with difficult or anxiety-inducing situations, individuals have the inherent capacity to cope and employ defense mechanisms to protect themselves."
Displacement,Psychoanalytic Psychology,This defense mechanism in psychoanalysis involves shifting of impulses from an unacceptable target to a safer or more acceptable one. An example is redirecting aggression from a boss to a less-threatening loved one.,Al-Baqarah,178,"O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered...","This verse relates to displacement as it discusses the concept of legal retribution. Displacement is a defense mechanism that involves redirecting aggression from one target to another more acceptable one. In this case, the verse highlights the shift of intent or retribution to the legally appropriate target, ensuring that aggression is expressed within proper boundaries."
Dream analysis,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This is a key technique in psychoanalysis that interprets dreams to unearth unconscious desires or concerns. Freud viewed dreams as ‘the royal road to the subconscious,’ conveying unspeakable desires.",Al-Anbiya,5,"Rather, they say, 'Legends of the former peoples which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.'","Dream analysis seeks to interpret the symbols and hidden meanings in dreams. This verse can be related to dream analysis as it represents the skepticism faced by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) regarding his revelations. Dreams are seen as channels through which divine messages were conveyed to the Prophet, resembling the way dreams convey unconscious thoughts and desires in psychoanalysis."
Electra complex,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This concept, proposed by Carl Jung, is the female counterpart of the Oedipus complex. It entails a girl’s psychosexual competition with her mother for her father’s attraction.",Al-Hujurat,13,"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female...","The concept of the Electra complex focuses on a girl's psychosexual competition with her mother for her father's affection. This verse reminds humanity of their creation from male and female. Although not directly related to the Electra complex, it emphasizes the natural interpersonal dynamics within familial relationships, including those between parents and children."
Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This proposes a lifespan model of development, comprising eight stages from infancy to late adulthood. Every stage presents a crisis deriving from a conflict between personal impulse and the social world, resolution of which leads to competence in a specific area of life.",Al-Hadid,4,And He is with you wherever you are...,"Erikson's stages of psychosocial development propose a lifespan model wherein each stage presents a crisis between personal impulse and the social world. This verse conveys that Allah is with individuals wherever they are, providing support and guidance throughout their lives. It relates to Erikson's theory by emphasizing the importance of a supportive environment in resolving psychosocial conflicts and achieving competence in different areas of life."
Extraversion,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"A term representing one pole of a personality dimension, extraversion is characterized by sociability, assertiveness, and a preference for company. Extraverts are energized by social interaction.",Al-Isra,32,"And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way.","This verse relates to extraversion because it emphasizes the importance of maintaining appropriate social boundaries and avoiding immoral behaviors, which can be a concern for individuals with extraverted tendencies who may be more inclined towards engaging in social interaction and seeking companionship."
Free association,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"A method employed during psychoanalysis, it involves the patient speaking freely about memories, dreams, or thoughts. It’s a tool that helps uncover repressed feelings and experiences.",As-Saffat,103-105,"So they said, 'Are you indeed Joseph?' He said 'I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has certainly favored us. Indeed, he who fears Allah and is patient, then indeed, Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.' They said, 'Are you indeed Joseph?' He said, 'I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has certainly favored us. Indeed, he who fears Allah and is patient, then indeed, Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.' They said, 'By Allah, certainly Allah has preferred you over us, and indeed, we have been sinners.'","In this verse, Joseph reveals his true identity to his brothers, which can be seen as an act of free association. He freely expresses his thoughts, memories, and experiences to disclose information that was previously concealed from them, reflecting a similar process used in psychoanalytic therapy to uncover repressed feelings and experiences."
Freudian slip,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This is an unintentional error — verbal or memory — which unveils repressed feelings or thoughts. According to Freudian theory, these slips hint at the workings of the subconscious mind.",At-Tahrim,5,"Perhaps his Lord, if he divorced you [all], would substitute for him wives better than you - submitting [to Allah], believing, devoutly obedient, repentant, worshipping, and traveling - [ones] previously married and virgins.","This verse relates to the concept of Freudian slip because it involves the possibility of a substitution or replacement (divorce with better wives) which is hinted unintentionally. Freudian slips are seen as revealing hidden desires or thoughts, and this verse touches upon the idea of a potential substitution which may resonate with the concept of Freudian slip."
"Id, ego, and superego",Psychoanalytic Psychology,"These are the three agents comprising the psychic apparatus defined by Freud. The Id is driven by primitive desires, the ego moderates between desires and reality, and the superego acts as the moral compass.",Az-Zumar,53,"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'","This verse relates to the concept of Id, ego, and superego because it addresses the idea of self-transgression and sinning, which can be seen as actions driven by the primitive desires of the Id. It also provides hope and emphasizes forgiveness from Allah, aligning with the ego's task of moderating between desires and reality, and highlights the merciful aspect of the superego as the moral compass."
Introversion,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"The opposing trait to extraversion in personality psychology, introversion involves drawing energy from one’s internal world of thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Introverts tend to prefer solitude, intimate interactions over large gatherings, and often engage in introspective activities.",Al-Baqarah,45,"And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah]","This verse relates to introversion as it highlights the importance of seeking help through patience and prayer, activities that are often associated with introverts who draw energy from their internal world. Additionally, it emphasizes the value of humility and submission to Allah, which can resonate with the introspective nature commonly found among introverted individuals."
Libido,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"In psychoanalytic theory, this term defines the sexual energy or force. Apart from strict sexual desire, this also extends to creative or productive drives in general.",An-Nisa,4:19,"O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion. And do not make difficulties for them in order to take [back] part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality. And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.",This verse emphasizes the importance of kindness and satisfaction in marital relationships. It highlights the need for a balanced and harmonious expression of the sexual energy or force (libido) within the framework of a lawful and consensual relationship.
Object relations,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This refers to interpersonal relations, emphasizing the internalization of experiences with significant others, particularly primary caretakers during early life. The term originates from psychoanalytic theory where “object” refers to the target of one’s drives and “relations” refers to interpersonal relationships.",Al-Isra,23-24,"Your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment. Whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], ""uff,"" and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word. And lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say, ""My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small.""","This verse emphasizes the importance of good treatment and respect towards parents, which is an essential aspect of object relations. It highlights the significance of internalizing positive experiences with significant others and maintaining strong interpersonal relationships, particularly with parents."
Oedipus complex,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This is a term from psychoanalytic theory, stating a child’s feelings of desire towards their opposite-sex parent and rivalry with their same-sex parent. Coined by Sigmund Freud, it’s considered a crucial stage in the formation of an individual’s sexual and social identities.",Al-Kahf,46,Wealth and children are [but] adornment of the worldly life. But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for [one's] hope.,"This verse alludes to the transient nature of worldly desires, including the affections or desires that individuals may experience towards their parents. It encourages focusing on enduring good deeds that bring spiritual growth and fulfillment, rather than being consumed by Oedipus complex-like feelings and rivalries."
Pleasure principle,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This Freudian concept is the governing force of the id, striving for immediate satisfaction of all wants, needs, and urges. Essentially, the urge to reduce tension by fulfilling desires characterizes human nature according to the pleasure principle.",Al-Qasas,79,"So he went forth before his people in his adornment. Those who desired the worldly life said, ""Oh, would that we had like what was given to Qarun. Indeed, he is one of great fortune.""","This verse reflects the human tendency to strive for immediate satisfaction and desires associated with the pleasure principle. It highlights the allure of worldly possessions and materialistic pleasures, often leading individuals to pursue fulfillment in temporary and superficial gains rather than pursuing a more holistic, spiritual path."
Projection,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"As a psychological defense mechanism, projection involves attributing thoughts, feelings, or motives that are unacceptable or unwanted in oneself to someone else. Essentially, the individual “projects” undesired aspects onto others as a means of avoidance.",Al-Hujurat,12,"O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin. And do not spy or backbite each other. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead? You would detest it. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is Accepting of repentance and Merciful.","This verse reminds believers to avoid making negative assumptions about others. It discourages the act of projecting one's own faults or negative perceptions onto others, emphasizing the concept of avoiding judgment and focusing on self-improvement. It encourages empathy, compassion, and personal introspection."
Reality principle,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This concept, contrasting with the pleasure principle, is managed by the ego and seeks to satisfy the id’s desires realistically and in a socially appropriate manner. It nudges an understanding of the real world and adjusts actions accordingly.",Al-Baqarah,286,Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...,This verse emphasizes the concept of reality principle by highlighting that Allah does not burden a person with more than they can handle. It conveys the message that one should adjust their actions and expectations to align with their capabilities and the reality of their circumstances.
Repression,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This defense mechanism involves burying distressful or unpleasant memories deep into the subconscious mind. It provides an escape from pain but can trigger anxiety, guilt, etc., indirectly influencing feelings and behaviors.",Al-Baqarah,271,"If you disclose your charitable expenditures, they are good; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, it is better for you...",This verse can be related to the concept of repression by highlighting the importance of hiding charitable acts to avoid seeking recognition or praise from others. It implies that burying the intention behind good deeds deep within oneself can be more rewarding.
Shadow,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"In Jung’s psychoanalytic theory, the shadow represents the unconscious part of the personality that the conscious ego rejects or ignores. It’s often the source of negative human traits, but also consists of creativity and insight.",As-Saffat,6-7,"Indeed, We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars, and as protection against every rebellious devil.",These verses signify the shadow aspect in psychoanalytic theory by indicating the existence of rebellious and deviant beings. It suggests that acknowledging and addressing the presence of negative traits and forces within oneself is essential for personal growth and self-awareness.
Sublimation,Psychoanalytic Psychology,This defense mechanism involves transforming unacceptable impulses or energies into socially acceptable actions or behaviors. It’s considered a mature way of dealing with inner conflict as the result is typically positive or beneficial.,An-Nisa,36,Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him...,"This verse encourages worshiping Allah alone and refraining from associating partners with Him. It relates to the concept of sublimation as it highlights the transformation and redirection of human impulses towards a socially acceptable form of worship, redirecting energy into a positive and beneficial outlet."
Synchronicity,Psychoanalytic Psychology,This Jungian concept refers to meaningful coincidences that seemingly lack a causal connection. Jung proposed synchronicity could be an explanation for parapsychological phenomena.,As-Saba,3,There was for [the tribe of] Saba' in their dwelling place a sign: two [fields of] gardens on the right and on the left...,"This verse illustrates an example of synchronicity by describing the simultaneous presence of two gardens on either side. It suggests a meaningful coincidence without a clear causal connection, inviting reflection on the deeper interconnections and possibilities in the world."
Transference,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"In psychoanalytic therapy, this features the redirection of feelings for a significant person to the therapist. It’s an unconscious process where the client projects feelings coming from past experiences onto the therapist.",Al-Isra,84,And We gave to Moses the Scripture and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel that you not take other than Me as Disposer of affairs.,"This verse reminds us to turn to Allah as the ultimate source of guidance and support, rather than projecting our feelings onto others."
Aversion therapy,Behavioral Psychology,"This is a behavioral treatment technique, used mainly to cease harmful habits and behaviors. It employs negative stimuli paired with the behavior to create a revulsion and thus condition the individual to avoid it.",Al-Baqarah,219,"They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, 'In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit.' And they ask you what they should spend. Say, 'The excess [beyond needs].' Thus Allah makes clear to you the verses [of revelation] that you might give thought.","This verse highlights the concept of aversion, where Allah emphasizes the harm (great sin) outweighing the benefits (some) of certain activities, such as wine and gambling."
Behavior chain,Behavioral Psychology,"This denotes a sequence of responses where each act serves both as a condition for the next and a result of the previous one. It’s a structure where one behavior leads to another, creating a ‘chain’ of actions.",Al-Kahf,28,"And keep yourself patient [by being] with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His countenance. And let not your eyes pass beyond them, desiring adornments of the worldly life, and do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever [in] neglect.","This verse encourages a sequence of actions: patience in the company of those who remember Allah, avoiding distractions of worldly desires, and not following those whose hearts are heedless of Allah's remembrance."
Behavior modification,Behavioral Psychology,"Broadly, it’s a therapeutic approach that aims to change maladaptive behaviors through altering environmental factors, reinforcers, and consequences. It employs techniques derived from operant and classical conditioning and has its roots in behaviorism.",An-Nisa,36,"Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good, and to relatives, orphans, the needy, the near neighbor, the neighbor farther away, the companion at your side, the traveler, and those whom your right hands possess. Indeed, Allah does not like those who are self-deluding and boastful.","This verse promotes behavior modification by encouraging worshipping Allah, being kind to others, and avoiding arrogance and self-delusion, aligning with the principles of behavioral psychology."
Classical conditioning,Behavioral Psychology,"A process envisaged by Ivan Pavlov, it involves forming an association between two stimuli. The former neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus evoking a conditioned response after repeated pairing with an unconditioned stimulus that naturally elicits an unconditioned response.",Al-An'am,99,"And it is He who sends down rain from the sky, and We produce thereby the growth of all things. We produce from it greenery from which We produce grains arranged in layers. And from the palm trees - of its emerging fruit are clusters hanging low. And [We produce] gardens of grapevines and olives and pomegranates, similar yet varied. Look at [each of] its fruit when it yields and [at] its ripening. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.","This verse highlights the natural process of classical conditioning, where rainfall is associated with the growth of various crops, each with its distinct characteristics and signs, showing how stimuli can become associated with specific responses."
Continuous reinforcement,Behavioral Psychology,This is a reinforcement schedule where each occurrence of a specific behavior is reinforced. It’s the simplest schedule where reinforcement occurs every time the desired behavior happens.,2:25,"And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, ""This is what we were provided with before."" And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.","And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, 'This is what we were provided with before.' And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.","This verse relates to continuous reinforcement as it describes the believers in Paradise being continuously provided with the provision of fruit, indicating the consistent reinforcement of their righteous deeds and belief."
Counterconditioning,Behavioral Psychology,"A therapeutic technique used to replace unwanted responses to stimuli with desired ones. It occurs when an individual associates something feared or avoided with positive outcomes, effectively undoing the condition.",3:148,And Allah gave them a reward in this world and the good reward of the Hereafter. And Allah loves the doers of good.,And Allah gave them a reward in this world and the good reward of the Hereafter. And Allah loves the doers of good.,"This verse relates to counterconditioning as it suggests that Allah rewards the believers not only in this world but also in the Hereafter. The desired behavior of doing good is associated with positive outcomes, effectively replacing unwanted responses with desired ones."
Extinction,Behavioral Psychology,"In conditioning, this refers to the progressive decrease and disappearance of a conditioned response. Occurs when the association between the conditioned stimulus and conditioned response weakens due to absence of reinforcement.",17:81,"And say, 'Truth has come, and falsehood has departed. Indeed is falsehood, [by nature], ever bound to depart.'","And say, 'Truth has come, and falsehood has departed. Indeed is falsehood, [by nature], ever bound to depart.'","This verse relates to extinction as it states that falsehood is bound to depart. In the context of conditioning, extinction occurs when the association between the conditioned stimulus (falsehood) and conditioned response weakens and eventually disappears."
Fixed-interval schedule,Behavioral Psychology,"This reinforcement schedule delivers reinforcement after a certain, fixed interval of time following the desired response. Here, the behavior increases as the time for potential reinforcement nears.",30:48,"Allah is the one who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds, and we drive them to a dead land and give life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Thus is the resurrection.","Allah is the one who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds, and we drive them to a dead land and give life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Thus is the resurrection.","This verse relates to fixed-interval schedule as it highlights the regularity of Allah sending the winds that bring life to a dead land. The reinforcement (life) occurs after a certain fixed interval of time, similar to how reinforcement is delivered after a fixed time interval in this schedule."
Fixed-ratio schedule,Behavioral Psychology,This is designed to reinforce behavior after a fixed number of responses. Responding occurs at a high rate provided the number of behaviors required is not excessively high.,92:5-7,"Indeed, We have created man into hardship. Does he think that never will anyone overcome him? He says, 'I have spent wealth in abundance.' Does he think that no one has seen him?","Indeed, We have created man into hardship. Does he think that never will anyone overcome him? He says, 'I have spent wealth in abundance.' Does he think that no one has seen him?","This verse relates to fixed-ratio schedule as it highlights the behavior of man spending wealth in abundance. The reinforcement (overcoming him) occurs after a fixed number of responses (spending wealth), suggesting that the behavior occurs at a high rate because the required number of behaviors is not excessively high."
Habituation,Behavioral Psychology,"This instinctive learning process involves decreased response to a recurring stimulus. Essentially, organisms become ‘used to’ stimuli through repeated exposure and respond less.",Al-Baqarah,118,"And those who do not know say, 'Why does Allah not speak to us or there come to us a sign?' Thus spoke those before them like their words. Their hearts resemble each other. We have shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain [in faith].","This verse relates to habituation by highlighting the concept of familiarity and the decrease in response to repeated exposure. Just as people may become less responsive to signs and miracles from Allah due to their own disbelief and lack of certainty, habituation also involves decreased response to a recurring stimulus over time."
Motivating operations,Behavioral Psychology,Motivating operations are environmental variables that alter the effectiveness of a reinforcer and the frequency of behaviors that have previously been reinforced by that stimulus.,An-Nisa,19,"O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion. And do not make difficulties for them in order to take [back] part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality. And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.","This verse relates to motivating operations by highlighting how external variables and circumstances can alter the effectiveness or desirability of a relationship. Just as difficulties and immoralities can negatively impact a marital relationship, motivating operations can change the effectiveness or frequency of behaviors that were previously reinforced."
Negative punishment,Behavioral Psychology,"A type of operant conditioning, it involves subtraction of something desirable to curtail undesired behavior. For example, taking away a favorite toy when a child misbehaves.",An-Nur,35,"Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche within which is a lamp, the lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly [white] star lit from [the oil of] a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire. Light upon light. Allah guides to His light whom He wills. And Allah presents examples for the people, and Allah is Knowing of all things.","This verse relates to negative punishment by highlighting the concept of taking away (subtraction) something desirable. Just as the example of light is given in this verse, negative punishment involves removal of something desirable (e.g., light) to decrease or curtail undesired behavior."
Negative reinforcement,Behavioral Psychology,"This aspect of operant conditioning strengthens a behavior through removal of a negative condition. For instance, taking painkillers (behavior) to alleviate pain (negative condition).",Al-Baqarah,286,"Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned. 'Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred. Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear. And pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy upon us. You are our protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people.'","This verse relates to negative reinforcement by highlighting the concept of removing a negative condition. Just as the prayer seeks Allah's forgiveness and mercy to alleviate the burdens and negative consequences of past actions, negative reinforcement strengthens a behavior through the removal of a negative condition."
Observational learning (modeling),Behavioral Psychology,"Albert Bandura theorized this process where individuals learn by observing others’ behavior. Modeling involves imitation, where behaviors are copied based on the perceived consequences to the model.",Al-A'raf,176,"And if We had willed, We could have set among you angels to be successors upon the earth.","This verse highlights the concept of observation and imitation by mentioning how Allah could have made angels successors on earth. It suggests that others can serve as models to be observed and imitated, just as angels could have been role models for human behavior."
Operant conditioning,Behavioral Psychology,This is a learning method which manipulates the consequences of behavior as an incentive for response. It’s divided into reinforcement (strengthening behavior) and punishment (weakening behavior).,2,286,Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...,"This verse highlights the concept that behaviors and their consequences are manageable and within the individual's capacity. It reassures that Allah doesn't burden anyone with more than they can handle, which is aligned with the idea of operant conditioning that behavior can be influenced by controlling the consequences."
Partial (intermittent) reinforcement,Behavioral Psychology,"Here, only some responses are reinforced, making the behavior more resistant to extinction. This can occur on a variety of schedules, including the fixed and variable schedules based on ratio or interval.",2,152,So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful to Me and do not deny Me.,"This verse emphasizes the concept of intermittent reinforcement, as it promotes the idea of remembering and being grateful to Allah. It implies that Allah's remembrance and rewards may not always be immediate and consistent, but intermittent or partial, encouraging believers to stay persistent and faithful."
Positive punishment,Behavioral Psychology,"This aspect of operant conditioning weakens the probability of a behavior by adding an undesirable consequence. For example, an individual receives a parking fine (addition of negative element) for parking illegally (behavior).",24,2,The [unmarried] woman or [unmarried] man found guilty of sexual intercourse - lash each one of them with a hundred lashes...,"In this verse, the punishment of flogging for sexual intercourse outside of marriage is an example of positive punishment. The undesirable consequence of the punishment is added to weaken the behavior and serve as a deterrent to engage in such actions."
Positive reinforcement,Behavioral Psychology,"This principle of operant conditioning strengthens a behavior by providing a positive stimulus or reward as a consequence. For instance, praise can reinforce the act of completing homework on time.",2,172,"O you who have believed, eat from the good things which We have provided for you and be grateful to Allah if it is [indeed] Him that you worship.",This verse promotes positive reinforcement by encouraging believers to eat from the good provisions provided by Allah and be grateful. The act of being grateful (behavior) is reinforced by the provision of good things (positive stimulus) as a consequence.
Premack principle,Behavioral Psychology,"An idea from behaviorism, it dictates a more preferred activity can reinforce a less preferred one. Known as “grandma’s rule” — first, you work, then you play — it encourages good behavior with the promise of a desired reward.",39,10,"Say, 'O My servants who have believed, fear your Lord. For those who do good in this world is good, and the earth of Allah is spacious. Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account.'","This verse reflects the idea behind the Premack principle, where it states that those who do good in this world will be rewarded in the hereafter. It encourages individuals to engage in good behavior (working) by promising a desired reward (spacious earth, reward without account) later on."
Shaping,Behavioral Psychology,"A conditioning paradigm, it gradually teaches new behaviors through reinforcement of successive approximations towards the desired outcome. Thus, it shapes behavior, bringing it closer to the desired final act.",Quran,2:286,Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity.,"This verse reminds us that shaping or conditioning should be done gradually and within the capabilities of an individual. Allah does not burden anyone beyond their capacity, highlighting the importance of shaping behavior in a gradual and manageable way."
Stimulus discrimination,Behavioral Psychology,"A differentiation process in learning and conditioning, it enables an individual to distinguish between similar stimuli. The organism learns to respond differently as only one of the stimuli is consistent with the conditioned response.",Quran,39:29,Allah presents an example: a slave owned by quarreling partners and another belonging exclusively to one man - are they equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know.,"This verse encourages us to differentiate between different situations and stimuli, highlighting that not everything is equal or should be treated the same. In the context of stimulus discrimination, it reminds us to discern between similar stimuli and respond accordingly."
Stimulus generalization,Behavioral Psychology,"Contrary to stimulus discrimination, it describes a situation where similar stimuli elicit the same response. For instance, a child conditioned to fear a specific dog may start fearing all dogs.",Quran,98:5,"And they were not commanded except to worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and to give zakah. And that is the correct religion.","This verse emphasizes the universality and generalization of the command to worship Allah and follow the teachings of Islam. It signifies that the response of sincerity and worship is applicable to all circumstances, highlighting the concept of stimulus generalization."
Systematic desensitization,Behavioral Psychology,A behavioral therapy technique designed to reduce phobias and other abnormal fears. It entails a gradual process where individuals face the feared object or situation in a safe and controlled way until anxiety declines.,Quran,2:286,Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity.,"This verse emphasizes that Allah does not burden anyone beyond their capacity. In the context of systematic desensitization, it highlights the importance of a gradual and controlled approach when facing fears or anxieties. By gradually exposing oneself to their fears in a safe and controlled manner, anxiety can be reduced, as Allah does not place a burden on individuals that they cannot handle."
Token economy,Behavioral Psychology,"A positive reinforcement strategy in behaviour therapy, using tokens as rewards for appropriate behavior. Collected tokens can, thereafter, be exchanged for desired rewards or privileges.",Quran,53:39,And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives.,"This verse reminds us of the importance of effort and striving in achieving positive outcomes. In the context of a token economy, it signifies that rewards and privileges can be earned through the efforts and appropriate behavior of an individual, aligning with the fundamental principle that man is rewarded based on his striving."
Variable-interval schedule,Behavioral Psychology,"This reinforcement schedule provides reinforcement for the first response after an inconsistent period. It causes a steady, moderate rate of response, with the individual unaware of the exact timing of reinforcement.",2,286,Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...,"This verse relates to the concept of variable-interval schedule as it highlights the idea that Allah does not burden individuals beyond their capacity. It implies that the timing of reinforcement or difficulties in life may vary for each person, but it is within their ability to handle."
Variable-ratio schedule,Behavioral Psychology,"This schedule reinforces behavior after a fluctuating number of responses. Typically, it leads to a high and stable rate of responding with the reinforcement always remaining uncertain.",2,155,And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits...,This verse relates to the concept of variable-ratio schedule as it emphasizes that tests and trials are a part of life and can occur at uncertain intervals. It signifies that the level of steadfastness and perseverance in facing these challenges determines the reward from Allah.
Accommodation,Cognitive Psychology,This is a cognitive adaptation process wherein existing frameworks of understanding are adjusted to incorporate new information. It’s a part of Jean Piaget’s paradigm of cognitive development.,13,8,"Allah eliminates what He wills or confirms, and with Him is the Mother of the Book.",This verse relates to the concept of accommodation as it signifies that Allah has the power to eliminate or confirm any understanding or information. It implies that our cognitive frameworks should be adjusted to incorporate new information or revelations from Allah.
Anchoring and adjustment,Cognitive Psychology,"This refers to a cognitive bias where initial pieces of information are used as the reference point for future judgments. Individuals adjust their assessments from this initial ‘anchor,’ often insufficiently, hence being misled.",16,46,"Or that Allah may catch them in the midst of their going to and fro (in their jobs), so that there be no escape for them (from Allah's punishment)?",This verse relates to the concept of anchoring and adjustment as it highlights the consequences of individuals being anchored to their activities or pursuits without considering their ultimate purpose or accountability to Allah. It signifies the need to adjust one's judgment and actions based on the greater understanding of the divine purpose.
Assimilation,Cognitive Psychology,"In Piaget’s cognitive development theory, this is the process of integrating new information into existing cognitive schemas. It’s basic to learning and incorporates the novel experience within the prevailing understanding without changing the structure.",25,73,"And they denied him [prophet Hud], so We destroyed them. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.","This verse relates to the concept of assimilation as it demonstrates that the people of Hud refused to assimilate new information and guidance from the prophet Hud, clinging to their existing beliefs. It implies that resistance to assimilation can lead to negative consequences."
Attentional resources,Cognitive Psychology,"This theory asserts that attention is a resource distributed among tasks. Cognitive processes compete for these limited resources, hence it becomes difficult to adequately concentrate on multiple tasks simultaneously.",7:201,"Indeed, those who fear Allah - when an impulse touches them from Satan, they remember [Him] and at once they have insight.","Indeed, those who fear Allah - when an impulse touches them from Satan, they remember [Him] and at once they have insight.","This verse relates to attentional resources as it emphasizes the importance of focusing on Allah and seeking guidance in times of distraction or temptation. It suggests that by remembering Allah, individuals can gain insight and redirect their attention towards what truly matters."
Bloom’s Taxonomy,Cognitive Psychology,"This is a classification of learning objectives within education proposed by Benjamin Bloom in 1956. It’s a framework for categorizing educational goals into six levels of complexity: Knowledge (Remember), Comprehension (Understand), Application (Apply), Analysis (Analyze), Synthesis (Evaluate), and Evaluation (Create). This hierarchy not only defines intellectual activities but also supports educators in creating more comprehensive lessons or tests.",,,,
Cognitive dissonance,Cognitive Psychology,"Leon Festinger’s theory proposes discomfort arises when individuals face conflicting beliefs or actions. For resolution, they either change their beliefs, acquire new ones to create coherence, or trivialize the conflict.",53:2-4,"Your companion [Muhammad] has not strayed, nor has he erred, nor does he speak from [his own] inclination. It is not but a revelation revealed, taught to him by one intense in strength.","Your companion [Muhammad] has not strayed, nor has he erred, nor does he speak from [his own] inclination. It is not but a revelation revealed, taught to him by one intense in strength.","This verse addresses cognitive dissonance by reaffirming the absolute truth and reliability of the revelation received by the Prophet Muhammad. It signifies the importance of seeking truth and aligning one's beliefs and actions accordingly, even if it requires overcoming conflicting thoughts or external pressures."
Cognitive load,Cognitive Psychology,"This term refers to the total mental effort being used in the working memory. It delineates the load related to a specific task, which can impede learning if it exceeds the individual’s cognitive capacity.",2:286,Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...,Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...,"This verse highlights the concept of cognitive load by emphasizing that Allah does not impose a burden or responsibility on anyone beyond their capacity. It implies that individuals are capable of handling the cognitive load associated with their tasks and challenges, encouraging perseverance and self-belief."
Cognitive map,Cognitive Psychology,This is an internal mental representation of spatially arranged elements in the world. Tolman’s theory suggests organisms have such maps which help in navigation and understanding of the environment.,51:20-22,And on the earth are signs for the certain [in faith]. And in yourselves. Then will you not see?,And on the earth are signs for the certain [in faith]. And in yourselves. Then will you not see?,"This verse reminds individuals to observe and reflect upon the signs in the world around them. It implies that through introspection and observation, one can develop a cognitive map or understanding of the world and navigate through it with wisdom and insight."
Cognitive restructuring,Cognitive Psychology,"A core part of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), it involves changing negative or irrational thoughts to reduce psychological discomfort. This approach helps individuals counteract cognitive distortions, often associated with mental health disorders.",,,,
Cognitive Tool,Cognitive Psychology,"Based on the work of David Jonassen, this term refers to any device assisting with cognitive processes, such as memory, reasoning, and learning. Examples include mnemonics, mind maps, calculators, and digital technology like learning apps or cognitive training programs. These tools amplify cognitive abilities and compensates for cognitive deficits or weaknesses.",,,,
Confirmation bias,Cognitive Psychology,This pervasive cognitive bias leads individuals to favor information that confirms their existing beliefs or hypotheses. It often leads to statistical errors and poor decision-making.,,,,
Divided attention,Cognitive Psychology,Refers to the cognitive capacity to attend to multiple tasks at once. It’s a component of multitasking but can often result in decreased overall performance due to attentional resources being split.,,,,
Dual-coding theory,Cognitive Psychology,"Paivio’s proposition suggests information is processed in two ways: verbal and visual. Therefore, learning can be enhanced by using both channels simultaneously to encode information.",,,,
Explicit memory,Cognitive Psychology,"Also known as declarative memory, it pertains to conscious, intentional recollection of factual information, prior experiences, and concepts. It can further be divided into episodic (personal events) and semantic (general facts) memory.",Al-Baqarah,2:282,"O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write and let the one who has the obligation dictate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of the women errs, then the other can remind her. And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon. And do not be [too] weary to write it, whether it is small or large, for its [specified] term. That is more just in the sight of Allah and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you, except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves. For [then] there is no blame upon you if you do not write it. And take witnesses when you conclude a contract. Let no scribe be harmed or any witness. For if you do so, indeed, it is [grave] disobedience in you. And fear Allah. And Allah teaches you. And Allah is Knowing of all things.","This verse emphasizes the importance of writing down and documenting information, particularly when it comes to financial transactions. It highlights the significance of memory and recollection in ensuring justice, as well as the necessity of recording information to prevent misunderstandings and disputes."
Flashbulb Memory,Cognitive Psychology,"These are highly detailed and vivid ‘snapshot’ memories of momentous events. Often marked by strong emotional content, they feel as vivid as photographs, hence the name.",Al-Qamar,54:48,"Indeed, those who have adopted the calf will obtain anger from their Lord and humiliation in the life of this world, and thus do We recompense the inventors [of falsehood].",This verse refers to the people who worshipped a calf in the absence of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). It exemplifies a momentous event marked by strong emotional content and serves as a reminder of the consequences faced by those who deviate from the right path.
Functional fixedness,Cognitive Psychology,A cognitive bias limiting a person to use objects only in the traditional way. This inhibition of viewing things from a novel perspective hampers problem-solving and creativity.,Al-An'am,6:35,"And if their evasion is difficult for you, then if you are able to seek a tunnel into the earth or a stairway into the sky to bring them a sign, [then do so]. But if Allah had willed, He could have united them upon guidance. So never be of the ignorant.","This verse highlights the limited perspective of those who deny the truth and refuse to accept it, despite the presence of clear signs and evidence. It conveys the concept of functional fixedness by illustrating the inability of some individuals to see beyond their conventional beliefs and consider alternative perspectives."
Heuristics,Cognitive Psychology,"These are mental shortcuts or ‘rules of thumb’ used for quick decision making. While often helpful, heuristics can also lead to cognitive biases and systematic errors.",Al-A'raf,7:179,"And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.","This verse highlights the cognitive biases that can cloud the judgment and decision making of individuals. It portrays those who lack understanding despite having the faculties of hearing and sight, comparing them to livestock that operate on a primitive level without the ability to reason."
Higher-order thinking,Cognitive Psychology,"This involves complex cognitive processes that go beyond basic information processing. Popularized by Bloom’s Taxonomy, this encompasses critical, logical, reflective, and creative thinking, requiring individuals to synthesize, analyze, reason, comprehend, and interpret information. Higher-order thinking is intricately linked with problem-solving, decision making, and the transfer of knowledge across contexts.",Al-Imran,3:191,"Who remember Allah while standing or sitting or [lying] on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth, [saying], 'Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly; exalted are You [above such a thing]; then protect us from the punishment of the Fire.'","This verse encourages believers to engage in higher-order thinking by pondering over the creation of the heavens and the earth. It emphasizes critical thinking, reflection, and comprehension of the signs of Allah's creation, urging individuals to seek knowledge and understanding beyond the surface level."
Implicit memory,Cognitive Psychology,"Unconscious memory or automatic memory, it’s demonstrated in tasks where previous experiences help perform a task without conscious awareness of these experiences. These may be procedural skills or conditioned responses.",Al-Baqarah,286,Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...,"This verse highlights the concept of implicit memory by emphasizing that Allah does not burden a person beyond their capability. Implicit memories are often unconscious and automatic, and this verse reminds us that Allah understands our abilities and only assigns us tasks within our capacity."
Long-term memory,Cognitive Psychology,"Referring to the storage system holding unlimited amounts of information for an extended period, it includes knowledge, beliefs, experiences, images, skills, etc. Its accuracy may degrade over time.",Al-Baqarah,45,"And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah ]","This verse encourages seeking help through patience and prayer, which can help in strengthening long-term memory. By remaining patient and seeking support from Allah, the verse implies that one can rely on their long-term memory and abilities to face challenges with perseverance."
Mental set,Cognitive Psychology,This term describes a habitual approach to problem-solving or a tendency to approach a scenario from a singular perspective. It aids in speedy decision-making but may hinder creativity and novel solutions.,Al-Isra,36,"And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned.","This verse advises against pursuing things without knowledge, which is related to mental set. It reminds individuals to broaden their perspectives and not limit themselves to a singular way of thinking. By seeking knowledge and avoiding a fixed mental set, one can avoid making decisions based on limited information."
Metacognition,Cognitive Psychology,"Known as ‘thinking about thinking,’ metacognition involves awareness and control over one’s cognitive processes. It enhances learning and problem-solving capabilities as it relocates the individual’s control over cognitive functions.",Al-A`raf,179,"And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.","This verse highlights the importance of metacognition by pointing out how some individuals possess capabilities but do not utilize them effectively. It emphasizes that having the ability to understand (heart), see (eyes), and hear (ears) is not enough unless one introspects and reflects upon their cognitive processes. Metacognition helps individuals reach a higher level of awareness and avoid being 'heedless' in their thinking and actions."
Prospective memory,Cognitive Psychology,"It’s the memory of actions to be taken in the future or remembering to remember. For example, remembering to take medication at a particular time showcases prospective memory.",Al-Hashr,18,"O you who have believed, fear Allah. And let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow - and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do.","This verse highlights the importance of prospective memory by emphasizing the need to be mindful of the actions we take for the future. It encourages believers to fear Allah and consider their actions and decisions in light of the consequences they may face tomorrow. By remembering and being aware of our responsibilities, we can cultivate stronger prospective memory and fulfill our obligations in a timely manner."
Representativeness heuristic,Cognitive Psychology,"It’s a cognitive shortcut applied when making judgments about the probability of an event under uncertainty. It entails basing judgments on stereotypes or perceived category representativeness, often leading to errors in decision-making.",Al-Ma'idah,5:101,"O you who have believed, do not ask about things which, if they are shown to you, will distress you. But if you ask about them while the Qur'an is being revealed, they will be shown to you. Allah has pardoned that which is past; and Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing.","This verse reminds believers not to jump to judgment or make assumptions based on limited information, which aligns with the idea of the representativeness heuristic. It highlights the importance of seeking knowledge and not relying on stereotypes or preconceived notions."
Schema,Cognitive Psychology,These are cognitive frameworks or concepts that help individuals organize and interpret information. Schemas can be beneficial in assimilating new information but can lead to stereotypes if they over-generalize categories.,Al-Imran,3:7,"It is He who has sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific. As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them]. And no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allah. But those firm in knowledge say, 'We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.' And no one will be reminded except those of understanding.","This verse refers to the Quran as a Book containing precise verses and others that are unspecific. It warns against those who deviate from the truth and seek interpretations that suit their own desires. Here, the concept of schema is reflected in the idea of individuals interpreting information based on their existing cognitive frameworks, either seeking understanding or distorting the message."
Script,Cognitive Psychology,"A type of schema, scripts are knowledge about specific events or situations and the typical sequence of actions that they involve. For example, a restaurant script associates the events of arriving, ordering, eating, and paying.",Al-Muzammil,73:20,"Indeed, your Lord knows, [O Muhammad], that you stand [in prayer] almost two thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it, and [so do] a group of those with you. And Allah determines [the extent of] the night and the day. He has known that you [Muslims] will not be able to do it and has turned to you in forgiveness, so recite what is easy [for you] of the Qur'an. He has known that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling throughout the land seeking [something] of the bounty of Allah and others fighting for the cause of Allah. So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakah and loan Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allah. It is better and greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.","This verse highlights the concept of script by referring to the routine actions and sequence of events in Muslims' worship. It acknowledges that not everyone can engage in extended prayers, recognizing the diversity of individual abilities and situations. It encourages individuals to fulfill their obligations within their capabilities, illustrating the flexibility and adaptability of script-like cognitive frameworks."
Selective attention,Cognitive Psychology,"This cognitive process allows individuals to focus on one particular stimulus while ignoring others. It’s a crucial resource, given the brain’s limited capacity to process information.",Al-An'am,6:103,"Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted.","This verse emphasizes that Allah perceives all vision, while human vision is limited and cannot perceive Him. It demonstrates the concept of selective attention by highlighting the idea that individuals can choose to focus their attention on Allah's attributes and teachings, which they believe to be most important and beneficial."
Working memory,Cognitive Psychology,"Formerly termed short-term memory, working memory engages in processing information held temporarily. It’s involved in higher-level cognitive functions such as comprehension, learning, and reasoning.",Al-Baqarah,2:286,"Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned. 'Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred. Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear. And pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy upon us. You are our protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people.'","This verse highlights the concept of working memory by acknowledging the human capacity and limitations. It acknowledges that Allah does not burden individuals beyond their ability, recognizing the finite capacity of working memory. It also demonstrates humility by seeking forgiveness for forgetting or making mistakes, acknowledging the need for cognitive resources to comprehend and remember information."
Bystander effect,Social Psychology,"This social psychological phenomenon suggests individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when others are present. The greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is for any single person to help due to diffusion of responsibility.",Al-Ma'idah,5:2,"And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.","This verse emphasizes the importance of cooperation in righteousness and piety, suggesting that individuals should actively help and support others in doing good, even in the presence of others who may not be doing the same. It encourages individuals to overcome the bystander effect and take action in situations where help is needed."
Cognitive apprenticeships,Social Psychology,"This process involves learning through the guided experience on cognitive and metacognitive, rather than physical, skills and knowledge. It’s about cultivating critical thinking and problem solving in the learner, akin to the traditional apprenticeship’s trade skills.",Al-Baqarah,61:6,"And [recall] when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, 'O children of Israel, indeed I am the messenger of Allah to you confirming what came before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad.' But when he came to them with clear evidences, they said, 'This is obvious magic.'","This verse highlights the importance of guidance and teaching in the form of clear evidences, which can be related to the concept of cognitive apprenticeships. Just as Jesus delivered clear messages and teachings to help the people understand, cognitive apprenticeships involve providing guided experiences and knowledge to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills in learners."
Conformity,Social Psychology,"This social behavior involves individuals adjusting their attitudes, feelings, or behaviors to align with those of a group or social norms. Most people conform due to the desire for social acceptance and avoiding discomfort of being the outlier.",Al-Imran,3:189,"And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is over all things competent.","This verse reminds individuals of the ultimate authority and power of Allah. It suggests that one should conform and align their attitudes, feelings, and behaviors with what Allah has commanded and with the principles of Islam, rather than conforming to worldly desires or social pressures for acceptance."
Elaboration likelihood model,Social Psychology,This is a dual process theory describing the change of attitudes. It suggests two routes to persuasion: central (reasoning based on quality of arguments) and peripheral (superficial cues like attractiveness of the source).,Al-An'am,6:116,"And if you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead you from the way of Allah. They follow not except assumption, and they are not but falsifying.","This verse warns against blindly following the majority or being influenced by superficial assumptions. It aligns with the central route of persuasion in the elaboration likelihood model, which focuses on reasoning based on the quality of arguments rather than being swayed by peripheral cues. It encourages individuals to think critically and not be misled by popular opinion or assumptions."
Groupthink,Social Psychology,"Coined by Irving Janis, it refers to faulty decision-making in a group due to pressures for conformity, discouraging creativity or individual responsibility. This can lead to poor and irrational decisions.",Al-Baqarah,2:170,"And when it is said to them, 'Follow what Allah has revealed,' they say, 'Rather, we will follow that which we found our fathers doing.' Even though their fathers understood nothing, nor were they guided?",This verse highlights the dangers of blindly following traditions or the decisions of a group without critical thinking or guidance. It questions the validity of following previous generations' practices without proper understanding. It serves as a reminder to avoid groupthink and encourages individuals to exercise independent thinking and make rational decisions based on guidance from Allah.
Guided participation,Social Psychology,"A concept related to cognitive development, it’s the process where individuals learn from others by taking part in mutually shared activities. As opposed to direct teaching, it emphasizes shared learning through interaction.",39,18,"Those who listen to the Word, and follow the best thereof: those are the ones whom Allah has guided, and those are the ones endowed with understanding.","This verse emphasizes the importance of actively engaging with and following the teachings of the Quran, which can be seen as a form of guided participation. By listening to and following the best of the Quran, individuals are guided by Allah and acquire understanding."
In-group bias,Social Psychology,"This refers to the tendency to favor one’s own group. It’s a form of prejudice, leading to preferences for people who belong to our own group, sometimes fostering discrimination and conflicts.",49,13,"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.","This verse highlights that diversity among people, in terms of different tribes and nations, is intentional and serves the purpose of fostering understanding and mutual knowledge. It emphasizes that the worth of an individual lies in their righteousness, rather than their group affiliation, thereby discouraging in-group bias."
Obedience,Social Psychology,"Fundamental to social order, it’s a form of social influence where individuals follow directives from authority. While being a building block of social structure, it can lead to harmful consequences if the authority is malevolent.",4,59,"O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best [way] and best in result.","This verse highlights the importance of obedience to authority, which in the context of Islam includes obeying Allah, following the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, and respecting those in positions of authority. It emphasizes that obedience should be within the framework of belief in God and the final judgment, ensuring adherence to the highest moral and ethical standards."
Observational learning,Social Psychology,"This occurs when an observer’s behavior changes after viewing the behavior of a model. The observer does not necessarily need to perform any observable behavior during learning, the process may be internal.",68,36-37,"So what is the matter with those who disbelieve, that they hasten to listen from you [O Muhammad], and then say, ‘He is a madman’? But We will remove from them the coverings of [cognitive] dissonance, so they may observe the truth.","In this verse, the disbelievers are described as hastening to listen to the Prophet Muhammad's message but then dismissing it as madness. The concept of removing the coverings of cognitive dissonance suggests that by observing and reflecting upon the truth, individuals can overcome internal biases and learn from the message being conveyed."
Out-group homogeneity effect,Social Psychology,This cognitive bias refers to perceiving members of an out-group as more similar to each other than members of one’s in-group. It often results in stereotyping and promotes in-group favoritism.,23,52-55,"But those who believed and did righteous deeds will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein by permission of their Lord; and their greeting therein will be, ‘Peace!’ Have you not considered how Allah presents an example, [making] a good word like a good tree, whose root is firmly fixed and its branches [high] in the sky? It produces its fruit all the time, by permission of its Lord. And Allah presents examples for the people that perhaps they will be reminded. And the example of a bad word is like a bad tree, uprooted from the surface of the earth, not having any stability. Allah keeps firm those who believe, with the firm word, in worldly life and in the Hereafter. And Allah sends astray the wrongdoers. And Allah does what He wills.","This verse provides an example contrasting good and bad behaviors, using elements of nature as metaphors. By highlighting the firmness and stability of a good tree that produces fruit versus the instability and lack of roots of a bad tree, it reminds individuals of the importance of unity among believers and serves as a reminder to avoid perceiving out-groups as homogenous, thus challenging the out-group homogeneity effect."
Prejudice,Social Psychology,"This refers to preconceived opinions, attitudes, or beliefs about a person or group that aren’t based on experience or reason. Prejudice can spark stigma, stereotype, and discrimination, often rooted in ignorance.",Al-Hujurat,49:13,"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.","This verse emphasizes the equality and diversity among mankind, highlighting that people are created in different tribes and nations so that they may know and understand one another. It encourages individuals to overcome prejudice and discrimination by focusing on righteousness and piety rather than superficial differences."
Private Speech,Social Psychology,"Often observed in young children, private speech is the act of talking aloud to oneself, assisting in thinking and guiding behavior. Vygotsky theorized it as an important tool in children’s cognitive development.",Al-Qasas,28:25,"Then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness. She said, 'Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us.' So when he came to him and related to him the story, he said, 'Fear not. You have escaped from the wrongdoing people.'","In this verse, the act of the woman speaking aloud to Moses illustrates the concept of private speech. It demonstrates how speaking to oneself can assist in thinking, problem-solving, and conveying information."
Reciprocity norm,Social Psychology,This social norm suggests individuals repay what another has provided us. It’s seen across cultures and forms the basis of social cooperation and trust.,Al-Baqarah,2:195,"And spend in the way of Allah and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction [by refraining]. And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.","This verse encourages individuals to spend in the way of Allah and do good to others without expecting anything in return. It aligns with the concept of reciprocity norm, emphasizing the importance of giving and doing good deeds to establish cooperation and trust among people."
Scaffolding,Social Psychology,"A concept central to Vygotsky’s theory of cognitive development, it involves a more experienced individual aiding a lesser-skilled one in learning a new task. Supports are gradually reduced as the learner becomes more proficient.",Al-Jumu'ah,62:2,It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom - although they were before in clear error -,"This verse highlights the role of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a scaffold for the unlettered people. The Messenger is described as reciting verses, purifying, teaching the Book, and imparting wisdom to guide them from their previous state of error. It exemplifies the concept of scaffolding where a more knowledgeable person supports and assists those less knowledgeable in learning and understanding."
Self-fulfilling prophecy,Social Psychology,"This concept involves expectations about a subject which influence individuals’ behavior towards the subject. It consequently influences the subject to behave according to those expectations, making the ‘prophecy’ come true.",Al-Isra,17:80,"And say, 'My Lord, cause me to enter a sound entrance and to exit a sound exit and grant me from Yourself a supporting authority.'","This verse highlights a supplication to God where the individual seeks a favorable outcome and support. It reflects the concept of self-fulfilling prophecy as one's expectations and desires influence their future behavior and outcome. The verse expresses the desire for a positive entrance, exit, and supportive authority."
Self-serving bias,Social Psychology,"A common cognitive bias, it involves attributing one’s successes to personal characteristics, while blaming failures on situational factors. This bias nurtures self-esteem but can hinder personal growth and lead to skewed social perception.",An-Najm,53:39,And that man can have nothing but what he strives for;,"This verse highlights the concept of personal effort and striving in achieving success. It reminds individuals that their accomplishments are a result of their own exertion and dedication, countering the tendency to attribute success solely to personal characteristics and ignoring situational factors."
Social cognition,Social Psychology,"This refers to how people process, store, and apply information about others and social situations. It involves understanding and predicting others’ behavior and interpreting social cues.",Al-Hujurat,49:6,"O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful.","This verse emphasizes the importance of proper information processing and understanding before making judgments or taking action. It encourages believers to engage in critical thinking and careful evaluation of social situations, promoting healthy social cognition."
Social comparison theory,Social Psychology,Leon Festinger proposed this theory that suggests individuals define themselves through comparison with others to evaluate abilities and opinions. It emphasizes the intrinsic human drive to gain accurate self-evaluations.,Al-Isra,17:53,"And tell My servants to say that which is best. Indeed, Satan induces [dissension] among them. Indeed Satan is ever, to mankind, a clear enemy.","The verse encourages believers to focus on positive communication and reminders of goodness. By discouraging negative comparisons and divisive behavior, it promotes individuals to evaluate themselves based on righteous actions and not unhealthy social comparisons."
Social exchange theory,Social Psychology,"This posits that social behavior results from an exchange process aiming to maximize benefits and minimize costs. Essentially, people assess the worth of an interaction by subtracting the costs from rewards.",Al-Baqarah,2:195,"And spend in the way of Allah and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction [by refraining]. And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.","This verse emphasizes the idea of altruistic giving and doing good deeds. It highlights the importance of a social exchange that focuses on giving and contributing to promote mutual benefits and a harmonious society, rather than self-centeredness and personal gain."
Social facilitation,Social Psychology,"This is a phenomenon where individuals tend to perform simple tasks better when others are present. However, for complex tasks, the presence of others may lead to decreased performance.",At-Tawbah,9:101,"And among those around you of the bedouins are hypocrites, and [also] from the people of Madinah. They have become accustomed to hypocrisy. You, [O Muhammad], do not know them, [but] We know them. We will punish them twice [in this world]; then they will be returned to a great punishment.",This verse indirectly highlights the phenomenon of social facilitation by mentioning the influence of others' behavior on individuals. It implies that individuals can be influenced and adopt certain behaviors or attitudes depending on the social context they find themselves in.
Social identity theory,Social Psychology,"Proposed by Tajfel and Turner, this theory suggests individual’s self-concept comes from perceived membership in social groups. It explains intergroup behavior, particularly the bias and prejudice perceived between in-group and out-group members.",Al-Hujurat,13,"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you.
