Anima and animus,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"According to Jung, these are the male and female archetypes residing in the unconscious of individuals, respectively. The anima exemplifies the feminine principle in men, while the animus signifies the masculine principle in women.",An-Najm (The Star),45:4,"And that it is He who created the two mates, the male and the female,","This verse from the Quran acknowledges the inherent duality and complementarity between males and females, emphasizing the creation of pairs - the male and the female. In the psychological concept of anima and animus by Carl Jung, these archetypes represent the feminine and masculine aspects within individuals, respectively. The verse speaks to the interconnectedness and balance between opposites, highlighting the idea that both male and female principles are essential components that when integrated, contribute to wholeness and harmony within an individual. Just as Allah created male and female pairs as complements in nature, Jungs concept of anima and animus emphasizes the integration of both feminine and masculine characteristics within the psyche for personal growth and individuation."
Archetypes,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"In Jungian psychology, these represent universal, primal, and collective mental representations inherited from our earliest ancestors. They are prevalent in literature, art, and religious iconography across cultures and serve to channel experiences and emotions, resulting in recognizable behavior patterns.",Al-Araf,7:172,"And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], Am I not your Lord? They said, Yes, we have testified. [This] - lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, Indeed, we were of this unaware.","This verse highlights the belief in the concept of archetypes in Jungian psychology by indicating a collective primordial memory or recognition of a higher power within humanity. The idea that all human beings were once gathered together and made to bear witness to the existence and lordship of God taps into the notion of inherited, universal mental representations that transcend individual experiences. In the context of archetypes, this verse can be seen as portraying a deep, innate connection that all humans share with the divine or spiritual realm, serving as a fundamental archetype within the collective unconscious."
Collective unconscious,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"A term coined by Carl Jung, it posits the existence of a shared part of the unconscious mind among all humans, deriving from ancestral memory. It’s believed to contain archetypes, universal images, patterns, and instincts inherent in all of us.",Al-Araf,172,"And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], Am I not your Lord? They said, Yes, we have testified. [This] - lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, Indeed, we were of this unaware.","This verse highlights the idea of a shared experience or memory that all humans carry within them. The concept of all humans being created from a single soul and bearing witness to their acknowledgment of God before birth can be seen as a representation of a collective unconscious. It suggests a deep, universal connection among all individuals that transcends individual consciousness, resembling the notion of a shared unconscious part of the mind as proposed by Carl Jung."
Countertransference,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This refers to a therapist’s emotions and responses to a client, which can stem from the therapist’s own personal history. It’s typically considered as hindrance to therapy but can provide insight into the dynamics of the therapeutic relationship.",Al-Araf,7:43,"And We will remove whatever of ill-feeling is in their breasts. Rivers flow beneath them. And they will say: Praise be to Allah, Who has guided us to this. We would not have found the way had Allah not guided us. Certainly the messengers of our Lord brought the Truth. And it will be cried out to them: This is the Garden you have inherited in return for what you used to do. (7:43)","This verse from Surah Al-Araf highlights the concept of divine guidance and healing of emotional wounds. In the context of Countertransference, therapists may experience a range of emotions towards their clients, stemming from their own personal history and unresolved issues. However, just as Allah promises to remove ill-feelings from the hearts of believers and guide them towards healing and gratitude, therapists can also seek self-awareness, introspection, and guidance to overcome their countertransference reactions. By acknowledging and addressing these emotions, therapists can gain deeper insight into the dynamics of the therapeutic relationship and ultimately provide more effective support to their clients."
Death drive (Thanatos),Psychoanalytic Psychology,This is a compelling concept from Freud that suggests humans possess an inherent drive towards death and self-destruction. It counterbalances Eros (the life drive) and is often associated with aggressive behaviors.,Al-Imran,3:185,"Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your full compensation on the Day of Resurrection. So he who is drawn away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has attained [his desire]. And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion.","This verse from the Quran reminds believers of the inevitable reality of death that every soul will face. The concept of the death drive in psychoanalytic psychology aligns with the acknowledgment that all individuals, regardless of their desires and pursuits, will ultimately experience death. The idea of a human drive towards death and self-destruction can be viewed through the lens of this verse, emphasizing the transient nature of worldly pursuits and the importance of preparing for the afterlife. The verse serves as a reflective reminder that the ultimate goal should be to strive for salvation and eternal life in Paradise rather than being consumed by the fleeting pleasures of this world."
Defense mechanisms,Psychoanalytic Psychology,These are strategies employed by the ego to mediate the conflict between the id and superego. They are unconscious mental processes that guard the individual from anxiety or unacceptable thoughts and feelings.,Al-Araf,7:200,"And if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan, then seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He is Hearing and Knowing.","This verse can be related to the concept of defense mechanisms in psychoanalytic psychology. In times of distress or when faced with unacceptable thoughts and feelings, seeking refuge in Allah can be considered a form of defense mechanism to protect oneself from negative influences or temptations. Just as how seeking refuge in Allah provides a shield from evil suggestions, defense mechanisms in psychology aim to protect the individuals psyche from anxiety or disturbing thoughts by employing various strategies."
Displacement,Psychoanalytic Psychology,This defense mechanism in psychoanalysis involves shifting of impulses from an unacceptable target to a safer or more acceptable one. An example is redirecting aggression from a boss to a less-threatening loved one.,An-Nisa (Chapter 4),116,"Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin.","This verse highlights the concept of displacement by emphasizing the idea of redirecting ones focus and actions from associating others with Allah, which is considered a grave sin, to seeking forgiveness and repentance from Allah. In the context of psychological displacement, this can be compared to the redirection of impulses or emotions from a harmful or unacceptable target (association with others besides Allah) to a safer or more acceptable one (sincere repentance and seeking forgiveness from Allah). Just as displacement in psychoanalytic psychology involves shifting emotions to a less-threatening target, seeking forgiveness from Allah offers a healthier outlet for dealing with guilt or wrongdoings."
Dream analysis,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This is a key technique in psychoanalysis that interprets dreams to unearth unconscious desires or concerns. Freud viewed dreams as ‘the royal road to the subconscious,’ conveying unspeakable desires.",Al-Anam,6:69,"And they swear by Allah their strongest oaths that Allah will not raise up him who dies. Yes, it is a promise binding upon Him in truth, but most of mankind do not know.","This verse from Surah Al-Anam can be related to the concept of dream analysis in psychoanalytic psychology. In dream analysis, individuals often uncover unconscious desires, fears, and concerns that are not readily apparent in waking life. Similarly, the idea of Allah raising the dead in the afterlife can symbolize the revival of hidden thoughts and feelings that are buried in the subconscious mind. Just as dreams can reveal deeper truths about a persons psyche, the concept of resurrection in the Quran highlights the uncovering of hidden truths and the ultimate accountability of the soul. The verse emphasizes that despite peoples ignorance of this reality, it is a truth that remains binding and significant. This connection underscores the importance of introspection, self-awareness, and understanding the deeper layers of ones psyche for personal growth and development."
Electra complex,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This concept, proposed by Carl Jung, is the female counterpart of the Oedipus complex. It entails a girl’s psychosexual competition with her mother for her father’s attraction.",Al-Araf,7:28,"And when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said to Joseph, Come out before them. And when they saw him, they greatly admired him and cut their hands and said, Perfect is Allah! This is not a man; this is none but a noble angel.","This verse from the Quran relates to the concept of Electra complex in the sense that it reflects the theme of competition and admiration among women, specifically in the case of the womens reaction to Josephs beauty. The womens reaction to Joseph can be seen as a form of admiration or attraction towards a male figure, which in the context of the Electra complex, can symbolize the daughters desire to compete with her mother for the fathers attention or affection. Just as the women in the verse express admiration for Joseph, a similar dynamic can be perceived in the concept of Electra complex where a girl may experience feelings of competition and jealousy towards her mother for the fathers love and attention."
Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This proposes a lifespan model of development, comprising eight stages from infancy to late adulthood. Every stage presents a crisis deriving from a conflict between personal impulse and the social world, resolution of which leads to competence in a specific area of life.",Al-Imran,3:102,"O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him].","This verse highlights the idea of being conscious of ones actions and decisions throughout life, which is a key aspect of Eriksons stages of psychosocial development. Just like in Eriksons theory where individuals face various crises at different stages of life that shape their development, the concept of fearing Allah and being in submission to Him emphasizes the importance of navigating lifes challenges with a sense of moral duty and integrity. By aligning ones actions with the fear of God and living a life of submission, individuals can seek resolution to the conflicts they encounter and strive towards competence and fulfillment in different areas of their life as per Erikson’s model."
Extraversion,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"A term representing one pole of a personality dimension, extraversion is characterized by sociability, assertiveness, and a preference for company. Extraverts are energized by social interaction.",Al-Ankabut (29:45),[chapter:verse],"Recite, [O Muhammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows that which you do.","This verse encourages social interaction through the act of prayer, which is an essential aspect of Islam. Just as extraverts are energized by social interaction, believers in Islam are encouraged to engage in communal prayers and gatherings, fostering sociability and a sense of togetherness. Additionally, the concept of establishing prayer and remembering Allah can provide a sense of assertiveness and confidence in ones beliefs, reinforcing the characteristics associated with extraversion."
Free association,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"A method employed during psychoanalysis, it involves the patient speaking freely about memories, dreams, or thoughts. It’s a tool that helps uncover repressed feelings and experiences.",Al-Anam,6:59,And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear record.,"This verse from Surah Al-Anam highlights the concept of free association in the context of the vast knowledge of Allah. In the process of free association during psychoanalysis, the patient is encouraged to speak openly and without censorship about their thoughts and feelings. Similarly, in this verse, it is emphasized that Allah knows every detail, even the unseen, the hidden aspects, and the smallest details. Just as free association allows hidden emotions and memories to come to light, the belief in Allahs all-encompassing knowledge encourages individuals to be honest and open in expressing their innermost thoughts and experiences."
Freudian slip,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This is an unintentional error — verbal or memory — which unveils repressed feelings or thoughts. According to Freudian theory, these slips hint at the workings of the subconscious mind.",Al-Mujadila,58:7,"Do you not see that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth? There is no secret counsel of three but He is their fourth, nor of five but He is their sixth, nor fewer nor more, but He is with them wherever they may be; and thereafter, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did. Surely, Allah knows all things full well.","This verse highlights the concept of nothing being hidden from Allah, as He is aware of all that is concealed in the hearts and minds of people. In the context of Freudian slip, where unintentional errors reveal repressed thoughts or feelings, this verse signifies that even our subconscious mind, with its hidden desires or emotions, is known to Allah. The Freudian slip can be seen as a manifestation of the subconscious coming to the surface, and this verse reflects the idea that nothing can truly be hidden from the divine knowledge."
"Id, ego, and superego",Psychoanalytic Psychology,"These are the three agents comprising the psychic apparatus defined by Freud. The Id is driven by primitive desires, the ego moderates between desires and reality, and the superego acts as the moral compass.",Al-Araf,7:200,"And if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan, then seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He is Hearing and Knowing.","This verse from the Quran can be related to the concept of Id, ego, and superego in psychoanalytic psychology. In Freudian terms, the evil suggestion that comes from Satan can be likened to the primitive desires of the Id that are driven by impulsive and instinctual urges. Seeking refuge in Allah can be seen as the moderating function of the ego, which helps in managing and balancing these desires with reality. The concept of Allahs guidance and protection can be associated with the superego, acting as the moral compass or conscience that guides individuals towards making ethical choices in line with divine teachings. Just as seeking refuge in Allah helps in resisting sinful urges and aligning with righteous behavior, the egos role in managing conflicts between desires and reality resonates with the guidance provided in this verse."
Introversion,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"The opposing trait to extraversion in personality psychology, introversion involves drawing energy from one’s internal world of thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Introverts tend to prefer solitude, intimate interactions over large gatherings, and often engage in introspective activities.",Al-Anam,63:4,"Indeed, hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah.","This verse from Surah Al-Anam highlights the concept of introversion in a way that relates to finding solace, peace, and energy from ones internal world and introspective activities. Introverts often find comfort and tranquility in quiet contemplation, reflection, and connecting with their inner thoughts and emotions. The act of remembering Allah, which involves deep reflection, can provide a sense of calm and fulfillment to introverted individuals who draw energy from their internal world. It signifies the importance of seeking inner peace and solace through introspection and spiritual reflection, which aligns with the characteristics of introversion."
Libido,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"In psychoanalytic theory, this term defines the sexual energy or force. Apart from strict sexual desire, this also extends to creative or productive drives in general.",Ar-Rum,30:21,And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.,"This verse from Surah Ar-Rum highlights the concept of libido from a broader perspective of companionship and emotional connections. In psychoanalytic terms, libido is not only about sexual energy but also about the drive for emotional fulfillment and meaningful relationships. The verse reflects how Allah has created the natural inclination for affection and companionship between individuals, encompassing the idea of libido as the force driving not only sexual desires but also the need for emotional bonding and tranquility in relationships. The mention of affection and mercy between mates in the verse emphasizes the broader aspect of libido, which includes the fulfillment of emotional and psychological needs through meaningful connections with others."
Object relations,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This refers to interpersonal relations, emphasizing the internalization of experiences with significant others, particularly primary caretakers during early life. The term originates from psychoanalytic theory where “object” refers to the target of one’s drives and “relations” refers to interpersonal relationships.",Al-Furqan (25:74),25:74,"And they say, Praise to God, who has favored us over many of His believing servants.","This verse relates to the concept of object relations in the sense of gratitude towards significant others. In the context of psychoanalytic theory, individuals internalize experiences with significant others, such as caretakers, which shapes their interpersonal relationships. In this verse, believers express their gratitude towards Allah for favoring them over others, highlighting the emotional connection, appreciation, and positive regard toward the object of their faith. This reflects the importance of internalizing positive object relations, such as feelings of gratitude and favor, which can greatly impact ones psychological well-being."
Oedipus complex,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This is a term from psychoanalytic theory, stating a child’s feelings of desire towards their opposite-sex parent and rivalry with their same-sex parent. Coined by Sigmund Freud, it’s considered a crucial stage in the formation of an individual’s sexual and social identities.",Al-Baqarah,2:256,There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in false deities and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.,"While this verse does not directly address the Oedipus complex, it highlights the concept of desire and belief. The natural feelings of desire and attachment that individuals may have towards their parents are a part of the fitrah (natural disposition) that Allah has created in humans. The verse emphasizes free will and choice in matters of faith and belief, which can be related to the psychological complexities of familial relationships and desires explored in the Oedipus complex within the context of human nature and decision-making."
Pleasure principle,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This Freudian concept is the governing force of the id, striving for immediate satisfaction of all wants, needs, and urges. Essentially, the urge to reduce tension by fulfilling desires characterizes human nature according to the pleasure principle.",Al-Araf,7:179,"And We have certainly created many of the jinn and mankind for Hell. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.","This verse from the Quran highlights the aspect of human nature that is governed by desires and immediate gratification, which is akin to the pleasure principle in psychoanalytic psychology. The reference to people being like livestock, devoid of deeper understanding, can be seen as an illustration of individuals who are solely driven by the pursuit of fulfilling their wants and desires without consideration of long-term consequences or higher purposes. Just as the pleasure principle emphasizes the seeking of pleasure and avoiding pain without rational thought, this verse underscores the heedlessness and lack of higher reasoning that can result from being solely driven by immediate satisfaction."
Projection,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"As a psychological defense mechanism, projection involves attributing thoughts, feelings, or motives that are unacceptable or unwanted in oneself to someone else. Essentially, the individual “projects” undesired aspects onto others as a means of avoidance.",Al-Baqarah,2:286,Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear ...,"This verse from Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes the concept of personal responsibility and accountability. In the context of projection as a defense mechanism, individuals often project their own burdens and negative aspects onto others in order to avoid facing them within themselves. However, this verse reminds believers that everyone is responsible for their own thoughts, feelings, and actions, and they should not burden themselves or others unjustly by projecting their own issues onto them. It encourages self-reflection, self-awareness, and taking ownership of ones emotions and behaviors rather than projecting them onto others."
Reality principle,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This concept, contrasting with the pleasure principle, is managed by the ego and seeks to satisfy the id’s desires realistically and in a socially appropriate manner. It nudges an understanding of the real world and adjusts actions accordingly.",Al-Baqarah,2:197,"And take provisions, but indeed, the best provision is Taqwa (piety, righteousness). So fear Me, O you of understanding.","This verse advises believers to take provisions before embarking on a journey, emphasizing the importance of realistic planning and preparation. By instilling Taqwa (piety and righteousness) as the ultimate provision, it highlights the concept of the reality principle in managing desires realistically and in a socially appropriate manner. Just as the verse encourages believers to act sensibly and make practical preparations for their journey, the reality principle, guided by the ego, helps individuals navigate the real world by adjusting their actions in accordance with social norms and realistic considerations."
Repression,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"This defense mechanism involves burying distressful or unpleasant memories deep into the subconscious mind. It provides an escape from pain but can trigger anxiety, guilt, etc., indirectly influencing feelings and behaviors.",Al-Baqarah,2:85,"Then do you believe in a part of the Scripture and reject the rest? But what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection, they will be sent back to the severest punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.","This verse from Surah Al-Baqarah addresses the concept of repression in a broader sense. When individuals engage in repressing distressful or unpleasant memories by selectively believing in only a part of the truth and denying or burying the rest deep into their subconscious mind, it can lead to negative consequences. Just as ignoring parts of the scripture can lead to disgrace in worldly life and severe punishment in the Hereafter, repressing unpleasant memories can lead to anxiety, guilt, and internal conflict. The verse highlights the importance of facing reality in its entirety rather than selectively repressing parts of it to avoid discomfort."
Shadow,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"In Jung’s psychoanalytic theory, the shadow represents the unconscious part of the personality that the conscious ego rejects or ignores. It’s often the source of negative human traits, but also consists of creativity and insight.",Surah Al-Araf,7:172,"And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], Am I not your Lord? They said, Yes, we have testified. [This] - lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, Indeed, we were of this unaware.","This verse highlights the concept of the unconscious part of human nature, similar to the Jungian concept of the shadow. In this verse, it is portrayed that humans have an inherent awareness of their connection to a higher power (Allah), but this awareness can become buried in the unconscious mind due to the distractions of the material world. It emphasizes the idea that there are deeper layers of the self that may be overlooked or rejected by the conscious ego, which aligns with the notion of the shadow in psychoanalytic psychology. The shadow aspect, like the unconscious connection to Allah in this verse, can hold both negative traits and hidden potentials waiting to be recognized and integrated into ones conscious awareness for personal growth and wholeness."
Sublimation,Psychoanalytic Psychology,This defense mechanism involves transforming unacceptable impulses or energies into socially acceptable actions or behaviors. It’s considered a mature way of dealing with inner conflict as the result is typically positive or beneficial.,An-Nisa (4:79),"Whatever good happens to you is from Allah, and whatever bad befalls you is from yourself. (4:79)","Whatever good comes to you, it is from Allah; and whatever bad befalls you, it is from yourself. And We have sent you [Muhammad] to the people as a messenger, and sufficient is Allah as Witness.","This verse highlights the concept of taking responsibility for ones actions and outcomes, which is a key aspect of sublimation. In the process of sublimation, individuals acknowledge their inner conflicts and impulses, and instead of acting upon them in socially unacceptable ways, they channel these energies into positive and constructive behaviors. By recognizing that good and bad outcomes are linked to ones own actions, individuals can engage in self-reflection, accept responsibility, and strive towards transformation and personal growth. This verse emphasizes the importance of directing ones energies towards good deeds and taking ownership of ones choices, which is in line with the mature coping mechanism of sublimation in psychoanalytic psychology."
Synchronicity,Psychoanalytic Psychology,This Jungian concept refers to meaningful coincidences that seemingly lack a causal connection. Jung proposed synchronicity could be an explanation for parapsychological phenomena.,An-Nahl (The Bee),16:77,"To Allah belongs the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. And the command for the Hour is but as a glance of the eye or it is nearer. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.","This verse emphasizes the belief in the unseen aspects of the world that are beyond our understanding and perception. Synchronicity, as a concept of meaningful coincidences without a clear causal connection, can be seen as part of the unseen or divine aspects of the universe that are beyond our comprehension. It highlights the idea that there are forces at work in the world that may be beyond our immediate awareness or explanation, similar to how synchronicity involves events that seem connected in a meaningful way despite lacking an obvious cause and effect relationship."
Transference,Psychoanalytic Psychology,"In psychoanalytic therapy, this features the redirection of feelings for a significant person to the therapist. It’s an unconscious process where the client projects feelings coming from past experiences onto the therapist.",Al-Anam,94,"And certainly you have come to Us individually as We created you the first time, and you have left behind that which We bestowed upon you. And We do not see with you your ’intercessors‘ about whom you asserted that they were Allah’s partners in respect to you. Certainly (all) the ties between you have been cut off, and that which you used to assert has failed you.","This verse highlights the concept of transference in a broader sense by emphasizing the individuals direct relationship and return to Allah without any intermediaries. In psychoanalytic terms, transference involves projecting feelings onto another person, often due to unresolved issues from the past. However, this verse reminds us that ultimately, our connection with Allah is direct and devoid of any projections or intermediaries. It underscores the importance of addressing and resolving our feelings and issues directly with Allah without the need for transferring them onto others."
Aversion therapy,Behavioral Psychology,"This is a behavioral treatment technique, used mainly to cease harmful habits and behaviors. It employs negative stimuli paired with the behavior to create a revulsion and thus condition the individual to avoid it.",Al-Baqarah,2:216,"Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah knows, while you know not.","In this verse, Allah acknowledges that there may be things that are disliked or aversive to individuals, yet these things may ultimately be beneficial. Aversion therapy works on a similar principle by employing negative stimuli to create discomfort or aversion towards certain behaviors, with the intention of promoting positive change. Just as individuals may dislike the process of aversion therapy initially but benefit from it in the long run, the verse highlights the idea that what is perceived as aversive may actually hold benefits beyond ones immediate understanding."
Behavior chain,Behavioral Psychology,"This denotes a sequence of responses where each act serves both as a condition for the next and a result of the previous one. It’s a structure where one behavior leads to another, creating a ‘chain’ of actions.",Al-Baqarah,286,Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...,"This verse highlights the concept in which the Quran assures believers that they are not burdened with more than they can handle. In the context of a behavior chain, this verse implies that in any given sequence of actions or behaviors, an individual is capable of managing and handling each step as they come. The idea is that each behavior in the chain is manageable and within ones capacity to handle, just like how Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capability. This reassurance can help individuals navigate behavior chains with a sense of empowerment and capability, knowing that they have the strength to deal with each step in the sequence."
Behavior modification,Behavioral Psychology,"Broadly, it’s a therapeutic approach that aims to change maladaptive behaviors through altering environmental factors, reinforcers, and consequences. It employs techniques derived from operant and classical conditioning and has its roots in behaviorism.",An-Nahl,16:90,"Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded.","This verse from Surah An-Nahl highlights the importance of behavior modification in the context of Islamic teachings. Here, Allah emphasizes the promotion of good conduct and righteousness while prohibiting immorality and oppression. This instruction aligns with the concept of behavior modification, as it involves changing maladaptive behaviors by reinforcing positive actions and discouraging negative ones. By following Allahs guidance to engage in just and virtuous behavior, Muslims are encouraged to modify their conduct in a way that leads to personal growth and spiritual development."
Classical conditioning,Behavioral Psychology,"A process envisaged by Ivan Pavlov, it involves forming an association between two stimuli. The former neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus evoking a conditioned response after repeated pairing with an unconditioned stimulus that naturally elicits an unconditioned response.",Ar-Rad (13:11),13:11,"Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves.","This verse highlights the concept of classical conditioning in a spiritual and psychological context. Classical conditioning involves the formation of associations between stimuli, and in this verse, Allah emphasizes that changes in behavior and conditions are linked to internal changes within individuals. Just as in classical conditioning, where an association is formed between stimuli, here the verse suggests that changes in ones external environment are contingent upon inner changes within oneself. It signifies the importance of personal growth and transformation in influencing ones circumstances and behavior."
Continuous reinforcement,Behavioral Psychology,This is a reinforcement schedule where each occurrence of a specific behavior is reinforced. It’s the simplest schedule where reinforcement occurs every time the desired behavior happens.,The Cow (Al-Baqarah),261,The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.,"This verse from Surah Al-Baqarah speaks about the concept of continuous reinforcement in a spiritual context. Just as in continuous reinforcement where each instance of a behavior is rewarded, here the act of spending wealth in the way of Allah is likened to planting a seed that grows into a bountiful harvest. The continuous act of charity is continuously rewarded by Allah, emphasizing the idea of consistent reinforcement for a specific behavior. This can serve as a reminder of the positive outcomes that can result from consistent and continuous acts of goodness and generosity in the eyes of Allah."
Counterconditioning,Behavioral Psychology,"A therapeutic technique used to replace unwanted responses to stimuli with desired ones. It occurs when an individual associates something feared or avoided with positive outcomes, effectively undoing the condition.",An-Nahl,125,"Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided.","This verse from Surah An-Nahl emphasizes the importance of using wisdom and good instruction when guiding or counseling others. In the context of counterconditioning, we can see a parallel with the concept of replacing unwanted responses with desired ones. By inviting others towards positive behaviors and beliefs in a gentle and wise manner, one can help them overcome negative associations and fears. Through positive reinforcement and guidance, individuals can gradually replace their unwanted responses with more desired and beneficial ones, similar to the process of counterconditioning in behavioral psychology."
Extinction,Behavioral Psychology,"In conditioning, this refers to the progressive decrease and disappearance of a conditioned response. Occurs when the association between the conditioned stimulus and conditioned response weakens due to absence of reinforcement.",Al-Baqarah,2:286,Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...,"This verse from Surah Al-Baqarah highlights the concept of resilience and the ability to endure challenges. In the context of extinction in behavioral psychology, just as individuals can adapt and overcome various trials without being overwhelmed, the conditioned response may gradually decrease and disappear when the reinforcement is removed. It signifies that Allah has created humans with the capacity to withstand difficulties and adapt to changing circumstances, similar to how conditioned responses weaken in the absence of reinforcement."
Fixed-interval schedule,Behavioral Psychology,"This reinforcement schedule delivers reinforcement after a certain, fixed interval of time following the desired response. Here, the behavior increases as the time for potential reinforcement nears.",Al-Furqan,25:68,"And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty.","This verse highlights the concept of fixed-interval schedule reinforcement in a moral context. In the behavioral psychology framework, reinforcement is provided after a specific, fixed interval of time following a desired action. Similarly, in this verse from the Quran, it is emphasized that wrongdoing and sin will result in a penalty or consequence, which may occur after a certain fixed interval of time. The fear of consequences following prohibited actions can serve as a form of reinforcement to discourage individuals from engaging in negative behaviors. Just as the concept of fixed-interval schedule reinforcement influences behavior in psychology, the anticipation of consequences in the afterlife, as mentioned in this verse, can influence moral behavior in individuals."
Fixed-ratio schedule,Behavioral Psychology,This is designed to reinforce behavior after a fixed number of responses. Responding occurs at a high rate provided the number of behaviors required is not excessively high.,Al-Rahman (The Beneficent),55:60,Is the reward for good [anything] but good?,"This verse can be related to the psychological concept of fixed-ratio schedule in the context of reinforcement. In behavioral psychology, a fixed-ratio schedule involves providing reinforcement after a fixed number of responses. Similarly, the concept of reciprocity and reward for good deeds is emphasized in this verse from Surah Al-Rahman. The verse highlights the principle that good deeds are rewarded with goodness, thereby reinforcing the behavior of doing good as a fixed-ratio schedule reinforces desired behavior after a certain number of responses. Just as in the concept of fixed-ratio schedule, where behaviors are encouraged through regular reinforcement, the Quranic verse emphasizes the positive reinforcement of good deeds with goodness."
Habituation,Behavioral Psychology,"This instinctive learning process involves decreased response to a recurring stimulus. Essentially, organisms become ‘used to’ stimuli through repeated exposure and respond less.",Al-Ankabut (29:64),29:64,"And this worldly life is not but diversion and amusement. And indeed, the home of the Hereafter - that is the [eternal] life, if only they knew.","This verse reminds believers that the distractions and pleasures of this world are transient and temporary, akin to habituation where responses decrease with repeated exposure. Just as habituation involves getting used to stimuli through repeated exposure, the verse emphasizes the idea that the allure of worldly pleasures should not distract one from the eternal life and ultimate purpose in the Hereafter. It serves as a reminder to not become desensitized or overly attached to the fleeting distractions of the material world, but to focus on the everlasting life that awaits in the Hereafter."
Motivating operations,Behavioral Psychology,Motivating operations are environmental variables that alter the effectiveness of a reinforcer and the frequency of behaviors that have previously been reinforced by that stimulus.,Al-Ankabut,29:69,"And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good. (Quran 29:69)","This verse from the Quran highlights the concept of motivating operations and reinforcement in behavioral psychology. In this verse, Allah promises guidance to those who strive and do good deeds. Here, the act of striving or putting effort towards righteousness is depicted as a motivating operation that enhances the effectiveness of the reinforcement, which is Allahs guidance. The verse suggests that by engaging in behaviors that are pleasing to Allah, individuals can increase the likelihood of receiving guidance and blessings from Him. Just like how motivating operations alter the effectiveness of reinforcers in behavior, the act of striving in the path of Allah can amplify the rewards and guidance one receives."
Negative punishment,Behavioral Psychology,"A type of operant conditioning, it involves subtraction of something desirable to curtail undesired behavior. For example, taking away a favorite toy when a child misbehaves.",Yunus,64:13,"But when trouble toucheth man, he crieth unto Us: When We bestow a favor upon him as from Us, he saith, This is due to me: but when we test him, he says, My Lord has humiliated me! (Pickthall)","This verse highlights the concept of negative punishment in a spiritual and psychological context. When a person experiences a setback or faces difficulties (negative punishment), they may turn to God and recognize their mistakes. In the verse, it is depicted that when a favor is taken away (something desirable is subtracted), such as in times of trial and tribulation, some people may realize their faults and seek guidance from God. Hence, the removal of a favor serves as a form of negative punishment to correct behaviors and bring about humility and reflection in individuals."
Negative reinforcement,Behavioral Psychology,"This aspect of operant conditioning strengthens a behavior through removal of a negative condition. For instance, taking painkillers (behavior) to alleviate pain (negative condition).",Al-Inshirah (The Expansion),94:5-6,"For indeed, with hardship [will be] ease. Indeed, with hardship [will be] ease.","This verse from Surah Al-Inshirah highlights the concept of negative reinforcement in the context of psychological resilience. Just as the removal of a negative condition (hardship) leads to ease, negative reinforcement in operant conditioning involves strengthening a behavior by removing a negative condition. When faced with challenges or hardships in life, it is important to remember that relief and ease will follow, similar to how negative reinforcement can lead to the strengthening of a behavior through the removal of an aversive stimulus. This verse serves as a reminder of the cyclical nature of negative conditions and subsequent positive outcomes, providing hope and encouragement during difficult times."
Observational learning (modeling),Behavioral Psychology,"Albert Bandura theorized this process where individuals learn by observing others’ behavior. Modeling involves imitation, where behaviors are copied based on the perceived consequences to the model.",Al-Araf,176,"And if We had willed, We could have elevated him thereby, but he adhered [instead] to the earth and followed his own desire. So his example is like that of the dog: if you chase him, he pants, or if you leave him, he [still] pants. That is the example of the people who denied Our signs. So relate the stories that perhaps they will give thought.","This verse highlights the concept of observational learning in the context of negative behavior. It draws a parallel between individuals who choose to follow their own desires without seeking elevation or guidance, and the behavior of a dog that continues panting whether chased or left alone. The verse emphasizes the consequences of deviating from righteousness and the importance of reflecting on the stories and signs provided for guidance. In the context of modeling, it underscores the significance of choosing positive role models and behaviors to emulate rather than following base desires without purpose or benefit."
Operant conditioning,Behavioral Psychology,This is a learning method which manipulates the consequences of behavior as an incentive for response. It’s divided into reinforcement (strengthening behavior) and punishment (weakening behavior).,Al-Araf,7:32,"Say, Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has produced for His servants and the good [lawful] things of provision? Say, They are for those who believe during the worldly life [but] exclusively for them on the Day of Resurrection. Thus do We detail the verses for a people who know.","In this verse, Allah emphasizes the concept of reinforcement, strengthening behavior in the context of following lawful provisions and adornments that have been provided by Him. Just as in operant conditioning, where reinforcement is used to strengthen behavior, in the Quran, Allah encourages believers to adopt and adhere to good and lawful behaviors in this world as a form of reinforcement for their faith and obedience. The promised reward on the Day of Resurrection serves as the ultimate reinforcement for believers who choose to follow the righteous path."
Partial (intermittent) reinforcement,Behavioral Psychology,"Here, only some responses are reinforced, making the behavior more resistant to extinction. This can occur on a variety of schedules, including the fixed and variable schedules based on ratio or interval.",Al-Kahf (The Cave),18:28,"And keep yourself patient [by being] with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His countenance. And let not your eyes pass beyond them, desiring adornments of the worldly life, and do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever [in] neglect.","This verse highlights the importance of patience and perseverance in seeking the pleasure of Allah. In the concept of partial reinforcement, where only some responses are rewarded, it is essential to maintain patience and consistency in ones actions and beliefs. Just like how in intermittent reinforcement, not every response is reinforced, believers are urged to remain steadfast in their faith and worship, regardless of the immediate outcomes or rewards, with the assurance that their efforts will be recognized and rewarded by Allah in the future."
Positive punishment,Behavioral Psychology,"This aspect of operant conditioning weakens the probability of a behavior by adding an undesirable consequence. For example, an individual receives a parking fine (addition of negative element) for parking illegally (behavior).",An-Nisaa (4:78),"Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you should be within towers of lofty construction.","Wherever you are, death will overtake you, even if you should be within towers of lofty construction. (Quran 4:78)","This verse emphasizes the inevitability of consequences, even in seemingly secure or fortified situations. In the context of positive punishment, where an undesired consequence is added to decrease a behaviors likelihood, the verse serves as a reminder that no one can escape the consequences of their actions. Just like how the undesirable consequence of death will eventually reach everyone, the application of positive punishment aims to deter or weaken certain behaviors by associating them with negative outcomes, leading to a modification in behavior."
Positive reinforcement,Behavioral Psychology,"This principle of operant conditioning strengthens a behavior by providing a positive stimulus or reward as a consequence. For instance, praise can reinforce the act of completing homework on time.",As-Saffat,40:40,This is indeed the supreme success.,"This verse emphasizes the concept of positive reinforcement by highlighting the ultimate reward and success that comes from following the guidance of Allah. In behavioral psychology, positive reinforcement involves providing a reward or positive stimulus to strengthen a desired behavior. Just as the promise of success in the hereafter serves as a reinforcement for righteous actions in Islam, positive reinforcement in behavioral psychology acts as a motivator for individuals to continue engaging in behaviors that lead to positive outcomes. The verse encourages believers to strive for success through obedience and righteousness, drawing a parallel to the psychological principle of positive reinforcement in reinforcing desired behaviors through the promise of reward."
Premack principle,Behavioral Psychology,"An idea from behaviorism, it dictates a more preferred activity can reinforce a less preferred one. Known as “grandma’s rule” — first, you work, then you play — it encourages good behavior with the promise of a desired reward.",Al-Insan (Chapter 76),3,"Indeed, We guided him to the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful.","This verse emphasizes the idea that guidance is provided, whether one chooses to be grateful or ungrateful. In the context of the Premack principle, the reinforcement of being guided towards the right path is always available, regardless of ones initial preference or attitude. Just as the more preferred activity can reinforce a less preferred one in the Premack principle, the offer of guidance and reward is constant and accessible, irrespective of ones initial inclination. The concept of offering a reward for choosing the right path aligns with the notion of reinforcing good behavior with the promise of a desired outcome, as highlighted in the Premack principle."
Shaping,Behavioral Psychology,"A conditioning paradigm, it gradually teaches new behaviors through reinforcement of successive approximations towards the desired outcome. Thus, it shapes behavior, bringing it closer to the desired final act.",Al-Imran,3:92,"Never will you attain the good [reward] until you spend [in the way of Allah] from that which you love. And whatever you spend - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it.","This verse from Surah Al-Imran highlights the concept of shaping behavior through reinforcement, as seen in the context of charitable giving. In the concept of shaping, new behaviors are gradually taught through reinforcing successive approximations towards the desired outcome. Similarly, in this verse, believers are encouraged to give from what they love, implying that by engaging in acts of charity and sacrifice, ones behavior is shaped towards embodying the qualities of generosity, selflessness, and obedience to Allah. The verse emphasizes that true spiritual growth and reward are achieved when individuals consistently practice and shape their behavior by giving from what they hold dear, reinforcing the development of virtuous traits."
Stimulus discrimination,Behavioral Psychology,"A differentiation process in learning and conditioning, it enables an individual to distinguish between similar stimuli. The organism learns to respond differently as only one of the stimuli is consistent with the conditioned response.",Al-Fatihah (The Opening),1:7,Guide us to the Straight Way,"In this verse, Muslims seek guidance from Allah to show them the correct path or way. This can be related to the concept of stimulus discrimination in behavioral psychology. Through the process of learning and conditioning, individuals are taught to differentiate between various stimuli, just like how Muslims are asking for guidance to discern the right path from potential misleading paths. By seeking guidance from Allah, individuals can develop the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, similar to how stimulus discrimination helps individuals respond differently based on specific stimuli."
Stimulus generalization,Behavioral Psychology,"Contrary to stimulus discrimination, it describes a situation where similar stimuli elicit the same response. For instance, a child conditioned to fear a specific dog may start fearing all dogs.",Al-Araf,7:100,"The weakened you feared the strong. But today I shall cast fear into the hearts of the strongest of them, while the people of reason have no fear.","This verse from Surah Al-Araf highlights the concept of stimulus generalization in the context of fear. It depicts a psychological response where the fear of a specific situation or entity (in this case, the strong) generalizes to encompass a wider range of stimuli. The verse indicates that even those who were initially strong and feared by others may begin to experience fear themselves, demonstrating how fear can generalize across different stimuli and contexts."
Systematic desensitization,Behavioral Psychology,A behavioral therapy technique designed to reduce phobias and other abnormal fears. It entails a gradual process where individuals face the feared object or situation in a safe and controlled way until anxiety declines.,Al-Anfal,8:60,"And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know but whom Allah knows. And whatever you spend in the cause of Allah will be fully repaid to you, and you will not be wronged.","This verse highlights the aspect of facing fears and challenges with preparation and power. In systematic desensitization, individuals gradually face their fears in a controlled manner to reduce anxiety and overcome phobias. Just as the verse encourages believers to prepare against their enemies with strength and without fear, systematic desensitization encourages individuals to confront their fears in a systematic and gradual way to diminish their impact. Both emphasize the importance of facing fears and challenges to overcome them successfully."
Token economy,Behavioral Psychology,"A positive reinforcement strategy in behaviour therapy, using tokens as rewards for appropriate behavior. Collected tokens can, thereafter, be exchanged for desired rewards or privileges.",Al-Baqarah,2:261,The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in every spike is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.,"This verse demonstrates the concept of rewarding positive behavior and acts of charity. In a token economy system, individuals are rewarded with tokens for demonstrating desired behaviors. Similarly, in the Islamic concept of charity, believers are rewarded abundantly by Allah for spending their wealth in His way. The idea of reward multiplication in this verse is akin to the principle of accumulating tokens for later exchange for desired rewards or privileges in a token economy system. Just as the verse highlights the abundant rewards for charitable acts, the token economy reinforces positive behaviors by providing tokens that can be exchanged for rewards, thereby encouraging and maintaining the desired behavior."
Variable-interval schedule,Behavioral Psychology,"This reinforcement schedule provides reinforcement for the first response after an inconsistent period. It causes a steady, moderate rate of response, with the individual unaware of the exact timing of reinforcement.",Al-Baqarah,261,The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.,"This verse illustrates the concept of variable-interval schedule in a spiritual context. Just as in the concept where reinforcement is provided at unpredictable intervals to maintain a moderate rate of response, Allahs reward for those who spend their wealth in His way is depicted as growing and multiplying in ways unknown to humans. The believers continue to strive and perform acts of charity without knowing the exact timing or quantity of the rewards, akin to the individual unaware of the exact timing of reinforcement in a variable-interval schedule. The verse emphasizes the faith, patience, and consistency required in pursuing good deeds without immediate, predictable returns."
Variable-ratio schedule,Behavioral Psychology,"This schedule reinforces behavior after a fluctuating number of responses. Typically, it leads to a high and stable rate of responding with the reinforcement always remaining uncertain.",Al-Ankabut,29:69,"And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good.","This verse from Surah Al-Ankabut highlights the concept of variable-ratio schedule in the context of striving and effort. In a variable-ratio schedule, reinforcement is provided after an unpredictable number of responses. Similarly, in the pursuit of striving for the path of Allah, believers are not explicitly told when or how their efforts will be rewarded, creating uncertainty similar to the variable nature of reinforcement in this psychological concept. The promise of guidance and support from Allah for those who strive reinforces their behavior of good deeds, maintaining a high and stable rate of engaging in righteous actions despite the uncertainty of the exact timing or form of the reward."
Accommodation,Cognitive Psychology,This is a cognitive adaptation process wherein existing frameworks of understanding are adjusted to incorporate new information. It’s a part of Jean Piaget’s paradigm of cognitive development.,Al-Baqarah,2:269,"He grants wisdom to whom He pleases, and whoever is granted wisdom, he indeed is given a great good and none but men of understanding remember. (2:269)","This verse from Surah Al-Baqarah speaks about the granting of wisdom by Allah to whom He pleases. In the context of cognitive psychology and the concept of accommodation, wisdom can be seen as the ability to adapt and adjust ones existing frameworks of understanding to incorporate new information. It implies that those who are granted wisdom are open-minded and receptive to new knowledge, which aligns with the idea of accommodating new information into ones cognitive schema. The concept of accommodation, as defined by Jean Piaget, involves adjusting ones existing cognitive structures to incorporate new experiences or information, ultimately leading to cognitive growth and development. This verse emphasizes the importance of being open to acquiring wisdom and understanding, which involves the process of cognitive adaptation and accommodation."
Anchoring and adjustment,Cognitive Psychology,"This refers to a cognitive bias where initial pieces of information are used as the reference point for future judgments. Individuals adjust their assessments from this initial ‘anchor,’ often insufficiently, hence being misled.",Al-Hujurat,49:12,"O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin. And do not spy or backbite each other. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead? You would detest it. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is Accepting of repentance and Merciful.","This verse from Surah Al-Hujurat highlights the concept of anchoring and adjustment in the context of making assumptions about others. The verse warns against forming negative assumptions about people based on limited information or initial impressions. In cognitive psychology, anchoring and adjustment bias can lead individuals to rely heavily on their initial perceptions or judgments about someone and fail to adjust them adequately. Similarly, in this verse, Muslims are advised to avoid making excessive negative assumptions about others and instead practice fairness and mindfulness in their judgments. By not anchoring their beliefs on incomplete or biased information, individuals can prevent misunderstandings and misjudgments, fostering harmonious social interactions based on sound assessments rather than presumptions."
Assimilation,Cognitive Psychology,"In Piaget’s cognitive development theory, this is the process of integrating new information into existing cognitive schemas. It’s basic to learning and incorporates the novel experience within the prevailing understanding without changing the structure.",Al-Baqarah,2:285,"The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers. All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers, [saying], We make no distinction between any of His messengers. And they say, We hear and we obey. [We seek] Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final] destination.","This verse from Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes the concept of assimilation in the cognitive sense as depicted in Piagets theory. The believers mentioned in the verse demonstrate their ability to integrate new information (revelations from Allah) into their existing cognitive schemas (their faith and beliefs) without altering the fundamental structure of their belief system. They accept and incorporate the new revelations from their Lord without making a distinction between different messengers or divine messages, demonstrating a seamless integration of new knowledge into their understanding of faith. This verse showcases how the believers cognitive schemas expand and adapt to new information while maintaining the coherence of their belief system, illustrating the skill of assimilation in a cognitive context as discussed in cognitive psychology."
Attentional resources,Cognitive Psychology,"This theory asserts that attention is a resource distributed among tasks. Cognitive processes compete for these limited resources, hence it becomes difficult to adequately concentrate on multiple tasks simultaneously.",Al-Muddathir,74:56,"No! Indeed, man transgresses, because he sees himself self-sufficient.","This verse addresses the tendency of human beings to overextend their attentional resources, thinking they are self-sufficient and can handle numerous tasks simultaneously. It reflects the concept of limited attentional resources as mentioned in cognitive psychology, where trying to divide attention among multiple tasks can lead to transgressions or inefficiencies. The verse serves as a reminder to prioritize tasks and acknowledge the limitations of human attention and capacity."
Bloom’s Taxonomy,Cognitive Psychology,"This is a classification of learning objectives within education proposed by Benjamin Bloom in 1956. It’s a framework for categorizing educational goals into six levels of complexity: Knowledge (Remember), Comprehension (Understand), Application (Apply), Analysis (Analyze), Synthesis (Evaluate), and Evaluation (Create). This hierarchy not only defines intellectual activities but also supports educators in creating more comprehensive lessons or tests.",Al-Baqarah,2:269,"He gives wisdom to whom He wills, and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good. And none will remember except those of understanding.","This verse emphasizes the importance of wisdom and understanding in the context of learning. In Blooms Taxonomy, the levels of comprehension and knowledge are crucial for effective learning. The verse reflects the idea that true wisdom and knowledge are granted by Allah to those who possess understanding. It highlights the value of comprehension and knowledge acquisition in achieving higher levels of cognitive functioning, which correlates with Blooms Taxonomys focus on progressing from basic levels of remembering and understanding to higher levels of analyzing, evaluating, and creating."
Cognitive dissonance,Cognitive Psychology,"Leon Festinger’s theory proposes discomfort arises when individuals face conflicting beliefs or actions. For resolution, they either change their beliefs, acquire new ones to create coherence, or trivialize the conflict.",Al-Maida,5:48,"And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth.","This verse from Surah Al-Maida emphasizes the importance of seeking coherence and truth in beliefs and actions. It highlights the need to resolve conflicts by adhering to the truth revealed by Allah, even if it challenges ones existing beliefs or inclinations. In the context of cognitive dissonance, individuals facing conflicting beliefs or actions can find guidance in resolving their internal conflicts by seeking the ultimate truth and aligning themselves with it, just as the verse instructs to judge between conflicting beliefs based on what Allah has revealed. This encourages individuals to strive for internal harmony and consistency by prioritizing the truth over personal desires or conflicting beliefs, mirroring the resolution process proposed by the concept of cognitive dissonance."
Cognitive load,Cognitive Psychology,"This term refers to the total mental effort being used in the working memory. It delineates the load related to a specific task, which can impede learning if it exceeds the individual’s cognitive capacity.",Al-Baqarah,286,"Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned...","This verse highlights the concept of cognitive load by emphasizing the principle of not burdening a soul beyond its capacity. In cognitive psychology, cognitive load refers to the mental effort and capacity that individuals have for processing information and tasks in their working memory. The verse reminds believers that Allah does not burden them with more than they can bear, which can serve as a source of comfort and guidance when individuals feel overwhelmed by cognitive tasks or challenges. Just as Allah understands each individuals capacity, it is essential for individuals to be mindful of their cognitive load and not exceed their mental capacity, as exceeding cognitive load can impede learning and cognitive functioning. This verse serves as a reminder to manage ones cognitive load effectively to ensure optimal performance and well-being."
Cognitive map,Cognitive Psychology,This is an internal mental representation of spatially arranged elements in the world. Tolman’s theory suggests organisms have such maps which help in navigation and understanding of the environment.,Al-Ankabut (The Spider),"64:And this worldly life is not but diversion and amusement. And indeed, the home of the Hereafter - that is the [eternal] life, if only they knew.","The worldly life is just a temporary enjoyment, whereas the Hereafter is the true life if only they knew.","This verse highlights the temporary nature of worldly life and the importance of focusing on the eternal life of the Hereafter. In the context of cognitive maps, one could interpret this as a reminder to not get too attached to the material aspects of this world and instead have a cognitive map that prioritizes the eternal aspect of the Hereafter. Just as a cognitive map helps in navigating physical spaces, this verse serves as a reminder to maintain a clear mental representation of our ultimate destination and purpose beyond the physical world."
Cognitive restructuring,Cognitive Psychology,"A core part of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), it involves changing negative or irrational thoughts to reduce psychological discomfort. This approach helps individuals counteract cognitive distortions, often associated with mental health disorders.",Ar-Rad,13:11,"Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. And when Allah intends for a people ill, there is no repelling it. And there is not for them besides Him any patron.","This verse highlights the importance of internal change for external outcomes. Cognitive restructuring involves changing negative or irrational thoughts within oneself, which aligns with the idea that Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. By engaging in cognitive restructuring, individuals can work towards improving their mental health and well-being, ultimately leading to positive changes in their lives."
Cognitive Tool,Cognitive Psychology,"Based on the work of David Jonassen, this term refers to any device assisting with cognitive processes, such as memory, reasoning, and learning. Examples include mnemonics, mind maps, calculators, and digital technology like learning apps or cognitive training programs. These tools amplify cognitive abilities and compensates for cognitive deficits or weaknesses.",Al-Baqarah,282,"O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write and let the one who has the obligation dictate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses – so that if one of the women errs, then the other can remind her.","This verse from Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes the importance of documenting agreements and contracts to avoid any misunderstandings or disputes. The act of writing down debts and having witnesses serves as a cognitive tool to enhance memory, reasoning, and learning in financial transactions. Just as the Quran instructs believers to utilize writing and witnesses as cognitive tools to keep accurate records and prevent cognitive deficits in understanding or recalling obligations, modern cognitive tools such as mnemonics, mind maps, and digital technologies also aid individuals in organizing and processing information effectively. Using cognitive tools enhances cognitive abilities and compensates for weaknesses, similar to the guidance provided in this Quranic verse for ensuring clarity and accuracy in dealings."
Confirmation bias,Cognitive Psychology,This pervasive cognitive bias leads individuals to favor information that confirms their existing beliefs or hypotheses. It often leads to statistical errors and poor decision-making.,Al-Muddathir (Chapter 74),74:31,"And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire; and We have fixed their number only as a trial for the disbelievers, in order that the People of the Book may arrive at certainty, and the believers may increase in faith – and so that no doubts may be left for the People of the Book and the believers – and so that those in whose hearts is a disease and the disbelievers may say, What could Allah intend by this example? Thus Allah leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. None knows the hosts of your Lord save Him. This is naught but a reminder for mankind.","This verse from the Quran highlights the concept of confirmation bias by emphasizing the importance of arriving at certainty and increasing faith through the messages and signs from Allah. The mention of how those with diseases in their hearts and disbelievers may question the intentions behind the examples given by Allah reflects the tendency of individuals to prefer information that aligns with their beliefs or doubts. Just as confirmation bias can lead to poor decision-making and errors in judgment, the verse reminds believers of the importance of being open-minded and seeking certainty in faith without falling prey to biased interpretations."
Divided attention,Cognitive Psychology,Refers to the cognitive capacity to attend to multiple tasks at once. It’s a component of multitasking but can often result in decreased overall performance due to attentional resources being split.,Al-Baqarah,2:283,"And whatever payment you give - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it.","This verse reminds us of the importance of focusing our attention and intention when carrying out tasks. In the context of divided attention, it highlights the significance of being mindful and fully present in each task we undertake, as Allah is aware of our actions even when our attention is divided. By prioritizing our focus and intention, we can strive for better performance and spiritual fulfillment, aligning with the concept of divided attention in cognitive psychology."
Dual-coding theory,Cognitive Psychology,"Paivio’s proposition suggests information is processed in two ways: verbal and visual. Therefore, learning can be enhanced by using both channels simultaneously to encode information.",Al-Anam,6:105,"And thus do We detail the verses, and [thus] the way of the criminals will become evident.","This verse speaks about how Allah presents His messages in different ways to ensure clarity and understanding for different types of people. In the context of the Dual-coding theory of cognitive psychology, where information is processed verbally and visually, this verse emphasizes the importance of presenting information in multiple channels to aid comprehension and memory retention. By using both verbal and visual channels, individuals can better encode and retain the message being conveyed, making it more accessible and evident."
Explicit memory,Cognitive Psychology,"Also known as declarative memory, it pertains to conscious, intentional recollection of factual information, prior experiences, and concepts. It can further be divided into episodic (personal events) and semantic (general facts) memory.",Al-Baqarah,2:282,"O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write and let the one who has the obligation dictate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of the women errs, then the other can remind her.","This verse from the Quran emphasizes the importance of documenting agreements and transactions for accountability and accuracy. In the context of explicit memory, the act of writing down debts or agreements serves as a tool to help in the recollection of factual information and past events. It highlights the significance of conscious and intentional recollection of information, as mentioned in the concept of explicit memory. By recording information, be it financial transactions or agreements, individuals are better able to retain and recall these details accurately, aligning with the principles of declarative memory."
Flashbulb Memory,Cognitive Psychology,"These are highly detailed and vivid ‘snapshot’ memories of momentous events. Often marked by strong emotional content, they feel as vivid as photographs, hence the name.",Al-Araf,7:172,"And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], Am I not your Lord? They said, Yes, we have testified. [This] lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, Indeed, we were of this unaware.","This verse from Surah Al-Araf can be related to the concept of Flashbulb Memory in cognitive psychology. Just as flashbulb memories are highly detailed and vivid recollections of momentous events, the concept of humans testifying their acknowledgment of the Lord in a significant moment in human history is also deeply ingrained in memory. The strong emotional content of this event, the sense of witness and the vividness with which it is described in the Quran resonates with the idea of flashbulb memories. This event is etched in the memory of all humans as a pivotal moment, much like how flashbulb memories capture key moments in ones personal history."
Functional fixedness,Cognitive Psychology,A cognitive bias limiting a person to use objects only in the traditional way. This inhibition of viewing things from a novel perspective hampers problem-solving and creativity.,Al-Maidah,5:100,"Say, Not equal are the evil and the good, although the abundance of evil might impress you. So fear Allah, O you of understanding, that you may be successful. (Quran 5:100)","This verse from Surah Al-Maidah highlights the concept of functional fixedness by addressing the bias that arises from being impressed solely by the abundance of evil deeds or traditional ways of thinking. Just as functional fixedness limits individuals to conventional ways of using objects, the verse cautions against being swayed by the prevalence of negative actions or rigid thought patterns. It encourages individuals to have understanding (critical thinking) and to not be entrapped by the traditional or common way of viewing things, urging them to fear Allah and seek success through exploring innovative solutions and perspectives beyond the ordinary."
Heuristics,Cognitive Psychology,"These are mental shortcuts or ‘rules of thumb’ used for quick decision making. While often helpful, heuristics can also lead to cognitive biases and systematic errors.",Al-Baqarah,2:170,"And when it is said to them, Follow what Allah has revealed, they say, Rather, we will follow that which we found our fathers doing. Even though their fathers understood nothing, nor were they guided?","This verse touches upon the concept of heuristics in cognitive psychology by highlighting how individuals may rely on inherited beliefs or traditions (mental shortcuts) without critically evaluating their validity. The verse cautions against blindly following traditions or societal norms without seeking understanding or guidance, as this can lead to cognitive biases and errors. It serves as a reminder for individuals to engage in critical thinking and reflection rather than relying solely on heuristics when making important decisions or judgments."
Higher-order thinking,Cognitive Psychology,"This involves complex cognitive processes that go beyond basic information processing. Popularized by Bloom’s Taxonomy, this encompasses critical, logical, reflective, and creative thinking, requiring individuals to synthesize, analyze, reason, comprehend, and interpret information. Higher-order thinking is intricately linked with problem-solving, decision making, and the transfer of knowledge across contexts.",Al-Imran,190-191,"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding. Who remember Allah while standing or sitting or [lying] on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth, [saying], Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly; exalted are You [above such a thing]; then protect us from the punishment of the Fire.","This verse highlights the importance of reflecting upon the signs of creation and pondering over the intricate design and purpose behind them. It emphasizes the concept of higher-order thinking by encouraging individuals to engage in deep contemplation, logical reasoning, and critical analysis of the world around them. By connecting the creation of the heavens and the earth to the remembrance of Allah and seeking protection from punishment, the verse illustrates the cognitive processes involved in synthesizing information, analyzing complexities, and seeking deeper understanding beyond surface-level observations. It serves as a reminder for individuals to exercise their intellect and engage in reflective thinking to comprehend the wisdom and order in the universe."
Implicit memory,Cognitive Psychology,"Unconscious memory or automatic memory, it’s demonstrated in tasks where previous experiences help perform a task without conscious awareness of these experiences. These may be procedural skills or conditioned responses.",Al-Araf,7:179,"And We have certainly created many of the jinn and mankind for Hell. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.","This verse from the Quran pertains to the idea of implicit memory in the sense that it highlights the concept of people being unaware or not understanding certain things despite having the ability to perceive. It speaks about the hearts that do not understand, eyes that do not see, and ears that do not hear, indicating a lack of conscious awareness or insight despite having the physical capabilities. This can be likened to implicit memory, where individuals may have learned or acquired certain information or skills without conscious awareness, and these may influence their behavior or responses unknowingly. The verse emphasizes the importance of being mindful and seeking understanding beyond the surface level, reflecting the unconscious aspects of memory and perception that can impact human behavior."
Long-term memory,Cognitive Psychology,"Referring to the storage system holding unlimited amounts of information for an extended period, it includes knowledge, beliefs, experiences, images, skills, etc. Its accuracy may degrade over time.",Al-Baqarah,2:282,"O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write and let the one who has the obligation dictate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of the women errs, then the other can remind her.","This verse highlights the importance of recording and writing down important information for future reference and accuracy, similar to the concept of long-term memory. Just as the Quran emphasizes the importance of documenting debts and obligations to maintain accuracy and justice, in cognitive psychology, long-term memory functions as a storage system that holds vast amounts of information for extended periods, allowing individuals to recall knowledge, experiences, and beliefs accurately over time. The act of writing down essential information, as encouraged in this verse, mirrors the process of encoding and storing information in long-term memory for future retrieval, serving as a reminder of the significance of preserving and organizing knowledge for effective cognitive function."
Mental set,Cognitive Psychology,This term describes a habitual approach to problem-solving or a tendency to approach a scenario from a singular perspective. It aids in speedy decision-making but may hinder creativity and novel solutions.,Al-Araf,7:179,"And certainly, We have created many of the jinn and mankind for Hell. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.","This verse highlights the concept of mental set and the limitation it imposes on individuals. By mentioning that some people have hearts but do not understand, eyes but do not see, and ears but do not hear, it emphasizes how a rigid mindset or mental set can lead to spiritual blindness and ignorance. Just like those individuals who are described as heedless in the verse, a mental set that restricts ones perspective to a singular approach can prevent them from gaining deeper insights and understanding different viewpoints. The verse serves as a reminder to be open-minded and flexible in ones thinking to avoid being confined by a fixed mental set."
Metacognition,Cognitive Psychology,"Known as ‘thinking about thinking,’ metacognition involves awareness and control over one’s cognitive processes. It enhances learning and problem-solving capabilities as it relocates the individual’s control over cognitive functions.",Al-Araf (7:179),7:179,"And We have certainly created many of the jinn and mankind. [Allah] will say, Will you acquaint Me with them except for one whom I have given knowledge? But most of them do not know.","This verse highlights the concept of metacognition indirectly by emphasizing the significance of knowledge and awareness. In the context of metacognition, individuals are encouraged to be mindful of their own thought processes, understanding the importance of knowledge and understanding ones own cognitive abilities. The verse implies that true knowledge comes from Allah, which can be deemed as a source of profound awareness that can guide individuals towards learning, problem-solving, and enhancing their cognitive capabilities through metacognition."
Prospective memory,Cognitive Psychology,"It’s the memory of actions to be taken in the future or remembering to remember. For example, remembering to take medication at a particular time showcases prospective memory.",Al-Munafiqun (Chapter 63),10,"And spend [in the way of Allah] from what We have provided you before death approaches one of you and he says, My Lord, if only You would reprieve me for a little while so I would give charity and be among the righteous.","This verse highlights the concept of prospective memory in a spiritual context. It emphasizes the importance of remembering to perform good deeds and acts of charity before its too late, indicating the significance of planning and remembering to engage in righteous actions in the future. Just as one should remember to take medication at a specific time for their well-being, this verse reminds believers to plan for their spiritual growth and acts of kindness before the end approaches."
Representativeness heuristic,Cognitive Psychology,"It’s a cognitive shortcut applied when making judgments about the probability of an event under uncertainty. It entails basing judgments on stereotypes or perceived category representativeness, often leading to errors in decision-making.",Al-Anam,6:116,"And if you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead you from the way of Allah. They follow not except assumption, and they are not but falsifying.","This verse from Surah Al-Anam addresses the concept of representativeness heuristic by cautioning against blindly following the majority without critical thinking. In the context of decision-making under uncertainty, relying on stereotypes or popular opinions, as the verse warns, can lead to errors and being misled from the right path. It highlights the importance of independent judgment and not falling into cognitive biases that may cloud ones discernment, which is a key aspect of the representativeness heuristic in cognitive psychology. Ultimately, the verse emphasizes the significance of seeking the truth and not being swayed by mere assumptions or the representativeness of a group."
Schema,Cognitive Psychology,These are cognitive frameworks or concepts that help individuals organize and interpret information. Schemas can be beneficial in assimilating new information but can lead to stereotypes if they over-generalize categories.,Al-Araf,7:179,"And We have certainly created many of the jinn and mankind for Hell. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless.","This verse discusses the concept of cognitive frameworks and how they influence individuals understanding. It highlights the importance of having the ability to truly perceive and understand information rather than just having the cognitive frameworks (hearts, eyes, and ears) without utilizing them fully. Schemas can be beneficial in interpreting information, but if individuals solely rely on their preconceived notions without actively engaging in understanding new information, they may end up misguided or astray, similar to how the verse describes those who have the physical abilities but lack true comprehension. This emphasizes the importance of critically evaluating ones schemas and not allowing them to blind one from the truth."
Script,Cognitive Psychology,"A type of schema, scripts are knowledge about specific events or situations and the typical sequence of actions that they involve. For example, a restaurant script associates the events of arriving, ordering, eating, and paying.",Surah Al-Kahf,18:23-24,"And never say of anything, Indeed, I will do that tomorrow, except [when adding], If Allah wills. And remember your Lord when you forget [it] and say, Perhaps my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this in conduct.","This verse from Surah Al-Kahf emphasizes the importance of having a script or plan while also being open to adaptations based on unforeseen circumstances. Just as in the example of a restaurant script where there is a typical sequence of actions, the verse highlights the significance of planning for the future while also acknowledging that ones plans may change according to guidance or circumstances. It illustrates the concept of having a structured framework (script) for actions while being open to the guidance of a higher power or the need for adjustments based on situations."
Selective attention,Cognitive Psychology,"This cognitive process allows individuals to focus on one particular stimulus while ignoring others. It’s a crucial resource, given the brain’s limited capacity to process information.",Al-Muddathir,74:31,"And We have appointed none but angels as wardens of the Fire. And We have fixed their number only as a trial for the disbelievers, so that those who were given the Scripture may be certain and those who believe may increase in faith, and those who were given the Scripture and the believers may not doubt, and that those in whose hearts is sickness and the disbelievers may say, ‘What does Allah intend by this example?’ Thus, Allah leaves to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And none knows the hosts of your Lord but He. And this is not but a reminder to mankind.","This verse from Surah Al-Muddathir addresses the idea of selective attention in a broader sense. Here, it speaks about how individuals perceive and interpret messages differently based on their beliefs and psychological state. It highlights the concept of selective attention in the sense that peoples preconceived notions, doubts, or emotional states can influence how they focus on certain information while disregarding others. Just as in the concept of cognitive psychology where individuals focus on particular stimuli while ignoring others, this verse illustrates how peoples internal states can impact their attention, understanding, and interpretation of the messages they receive."
Working memory,Cognitive Psychology,"Formerly termed short-term memory, working memory engages in processing information held temporarily. It’s involved in higher-level cognitive functions such as comprehension, learning, and reasoning.",Al-Ankabut (The Spider),69:19,"Have they not seen how Allah begins creation, then repeats it? Indeed that, for Allah, is easy.","This verse highlights the concept of working memory by emphasizing the continuous process of creation and recreation by Allah. In the context of cognitive psychology, just as Allah repeatedly engages in the cognitive process of creation, humans utilize their working memory to engage in processing information temporarily and repeatedly. This verse serves as a reminder of the cognitive abilities bestowed upon humans by Allah, enabling them to comprehend and reason through the temporary information held in their working memory. Just as Allahs ability to create is constant, humans working memory plays a crucial role in higher-level cognitive functions such as learning, reasoning, and comprehension."
Bystander effect,Social Psychology,"This social psychological phenomenon suggests individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when others are present. The greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is for any single person to help due to diffusion of responsibility.",Al-Maidah,5:2,"And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.","This verse from Surah Al-Maidah emphasizes the importance of cooperating in righteousness and piety, which can be linked to the idea of helping others in need. In the context of the bystander effect, individuals are reminded to not shy away from assisting someone in distress, even if others present are hesitant to act. It encourages individuals to overcome the diffusion of responsibility and take action by cooperating in righteousness, regardless of the number of bystanders present. This verse highlights the moral duty to help others and not to remain passive in the face of injustice or harm."
Cognitive apprenticeships,Social Psychology,"This process involves learning through the guided experience on cognitive and metacognitive, rather than physical, skills and knowledge. It’s about cultivating critical thinking and problem solving in the learner, akin to the traditional apprenticeship’s trade skills.",Al-Kahf,18:65-82,"He said, This is where you and I part company. I will inform you of the meaning of the things you could not bear with patience. As for the boat, it belonged to some needy people who made their living from the sea and I wanted to damage it because there was a king [coming] behind them seizing every boat by force. As for the boy, his parents were believers and we feared he would darken their days with his insolence and ingratitude. We wanted their Lord to give them in his place someone better than him in purity and closer to mercy. And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the town, and beneath it was a treasure that belonged to them. Their father was righteous and your Lord wanted them to reach their maturity and then dig out their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. And I didnt do this of my own accord. This is the meaning of the things you couldnt bear with patience.","In this verse from Surah Al-Kahf, Prophet Khidr guides and teaches Musa (Moses) through a series of events that seem illogical or unjust on the surface. Through these encounters, Prophet Khidr imparts profound wisdom and knowledge to Musa, demonstrating the concept of cognitive apprenticeships. Just like in cognitive apprenticeships where learning occurs through guided experiences, Prophet Khidr helps Musa understand the deeper meanings behind seemingly inexplicable actions. This verse highlights the importance of guided learning and mentorship in developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are central to the concept of cognitive apprenticeships in social psychology."
Conformity,Social Psychology,"This social behavior involves individuals adjusting their attitudes, feelings, or behaviors to align with those of a group or social norms. Most people conform due to the desire for social acceptance and avoiding discomfort of being the outlier.",Al-Imran,3:103,"And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of Allah upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided.","This verse highlights the importance of unity and solidarity among believers, emphasizing the idea of coming together as one community and avoiding division. In the concept of conformity, individuals often adjust their attitudes or behaviors to align with a group or social norms to achieve a sense of unity and belonging. The verse encourages believers to conform to the teachings of Islam and come together as a cohesive group, reflecting the psychological aspect of conformity for the sake of social harmony and acceptance."
Elaboration likelihood model,Social Psychology,This is a dual process theory describing the change of attitudes. It suggests two routes to persuasion: central (reasoning based on quality of arguments) and peripheral (superficial cues like attractiveness of the source).,Al-Anfal,8:22,"Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of Allah are the deaf and dumb, those who do not use reason.","This verse highlights the importance of using reasoning and intellect in making judgments and decisions. In the Elaboration Likelihood Model, the central route to persuasion involves thoughtful consideration of the quality of arguments presented. By emphasizing the significance of reasoning in this verse, it aligns with the concept of central processing in influencing attitudes and behaviors. Allah emphasizes the value of intellect to guide individuals towards making informed choices and avoiding being swayed by superficial cues or distractions."
Groupthink,Social Psychology,"Coined by Irving Janis, it refers to faulty decision-making in a group due to pressures for conformity, discouraging creativity or individual responsibility. This can lead to poor and irrational decisions.",Al-Maidah,5:48,"And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. (5:48)","This verse emphasizes the importance of independent thinking and not succumbing to the pressures of group mentality or consensus if it goes against the truth and what is right. In the concept of Groupthink, individuals in a group may withhold their true opinions or conform to the groups faulty decision-making process to avoid conflict or maintain harmony. The verse encourages individuals to uphold the truth even if it means going against the collective opinion, promoting critical thinking and individual responsibility in decision-making."
Guided participation,Social Psychology,"A concept related to cognitive development, it’s the process where individuals learn from others by taking part in mutually shared activities. As opposed to direct teaching, it emphasizes shared learning through interaction.",Al-Imran,3:159,"So by mercy from Allah, [O Muhammad], you were lenient with them. And if you had been rude [in speech] and harsh in heart, they would have disbanded from about you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter. And when you have decided, then rely upon Allah. Indeed, Allah loves those who rely [upon Him].","This verse emphasizes the importance of guided participation and shared decision-making, highlighting the significance of mutual interaction and collaboration in the learning and decision-making process. The verse illustrates how Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was advised to consult with his companions rather than dictating decisions unilaterally. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of shared learning and participation, as opposed to one-way teaching, which aligns with the concept of guided participation in cognitive development."
In-group bias,Social Psychology,"This refers to the tendency to favor one’s own group. It’s a form of prejudice, leading to preferences for people who belong to our own group, sometimes fostering discrimination and conflicts.",Al-Mumtahanah,60:1,"O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies, extending to them affection while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth.","This verse from Surah Al-Mumtahanah highlights the importance of not forming alliances with those who are against the beliefs or values one holds. In the context of in-group bias, it serves as a reminder to remain loyal to ones own group and not extend undue favor or affection to those outside of it who may hold opposing beliefs. By instructing believers not to take their enemies as allies, the verse emphasizes the idea of favoring ones own group and maintaining a sense of solidarity and unity within the community of believers. This aligns with the concept of in-group bias, where individuals tend to show preferences and support for members of their own group while exhibiting prejudice or discrimination towards those perceived as outsiders."
Obedience,Social Psychology,"Fundamental to social order, it’s a form of social influence where individuals follow directives from authority. While being a building block of social structure, it can lead to harmful consequences if the authority is malevolent.",Al-Araf,7:55,"Call on your Lord in humility and privately; indeed, He does not love transgressors.","This verse highlights the importance of obedience to the ultimate authority, which is Allah. It emphasizes the need to submit to Him willingly and humbly, without transgressing His limits. Obedience to Allah is seen as crucial for maintaining order and harmony in society, as it serves as a mechanism for individuals to follow directives that are just and beneficial. This concept of obedience to a benevolent authority echoes the psychological understanding of obedience as a fundamental aspect of social order. It also serves as a reminder that blind obedience to malevolent authorities can lead to wrongdoing and transgression."
Observational learning,Social Psychology,"This occurs when an observer’s behavior changes after viewing the behavior of a model. The observer does not necessarily need to perform any observable behavior during learning, the process may be internal.",Al-Muminun,23:21,Indeed in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day and remembers Allah much.,"This verse from Surah Al-Muminun highlights the concept of observational learning by emphasizing the importance of following the example of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). In psychology, observational learning occurs when individuals change their behavior after observing others, known as models. In this case, the verse encourages believers to observe the behavior and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad as a model to learn and adopt positive behaviors and values. By internalizing the example set by the Prophet, individuals can make behavioral changes that align with faith and righteousness without the need for direct instruction or explicit reinforcement. The verse reminds Muslims that observing and learning from the exemplary behavior of the Prophet serves as a guide for personal growth and spiritual development."
Out-group homogeneity effect,Social Psychology,This cognitive bias refers to perceiving members of an out-group as more similar to each other than members of one’s in-group. It often results in stereotyping and promotes in-group favoritism.,Al-Mumtahina,60:8,Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed Allah loves those who act justly.,"This verse emphasizes the importance of treating others justly, regardless of their religious or social group affiliation. It encourages believers to uphold fairness and righteousness in their interactions with people who may be considered as part of the out-group. By promoting just and fair treatment towards others, the verse discourages the out-group homogeneity effect by reminding individuals that every individual should be judged based on their actions and character, rather than being stereotyped based on group identity."
Prejudice,Social Psychology,"This refers to preconceived opinions, attitudes, or beliefs about a person or group that aren’t based on experience or reason. Prejudice can spark stigma, stereotype, and discrimination, often rooted in ignorance.",Al-Hujurat (49:13),"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.","O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.","This verse from the Quran emphasizes the equality of all human beings regardless of their ethnicities, backgrounds, or beliefs. It highlights that diversity among human beings is intentional and serves the purpose of fostering understanding and cooperation between different groups. Prejudice arises when individuals fail to recognize this diversity as a positive aspect and instead hold biased views based on ignorance or false assumptions. The verse encourages individuals to look beyond superficial differences and judge one another based on righteousness and character rather than prejudice."
Private Speech,Social Psychology,"Often observed in young children, private speech is the act of talking aloud to oneself, assisting in thinking and guiding behavior. Vygotsky theorized it as an important tool in children’s cognitive development.",Al-Araf,7:205,And remember your Lord within yourself in humility and in fear without being apparent in speech - in the mornings and the evenings. And do not be among the heedless.,"This verse emphasizes the concept of inward speech or private speech, as it encourages individuals to remember and commune with their Lord internally, in humility and fear. Just like how private speech serves as a tool for thinking and guiding behavior in psychological development, this verse underscores the significance of internal dialogue as a means of reflection, mindfulness, and connection to something greater. It highlights the importance of the unseen dialogue one has with oneself for personal growth and spiritual development."
Reciprocity norm,Social Psychology,This social norm suggests individuals repay what another has provided us. It’s seen across cultures and forms the basis of social cooperation and trust.,Al-Baqarah,2:195,"And spend in the way of Allah and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction [by refraining]. And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.","This concept is related to the idea of reciprocity, as highlighted in this verse where believers are encouraged to spend in the way of Allah and do good deeds without expecting anything in return. The verse emphasizes the importance of giving and doing good to others without seeking immediate compensation, trusting in the reciprocity norm that ones actions will be repaid by Allah in various ways. By adhering to this principle, individuals can foster social cooperation, trust, and goodwill among one another, embodying the essence of reciprocity across cultures."
Scaffolding,Social Psychology,"A concept central to Vygotsky’s theory of cognitive development, it involves a more experienced individual aiding a lesser-skilled one in learning a new task. Supports are gradually reduced as the learner becomes more proficient.",Al-Baqarah,2:286,Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear...,"This verse reminds believers that Allah is aware of each individuals capabilities and does not burden them with difficulties beyond their capacity to handle. In the concept of scaffolding in social psychology, a more experienced individual provides support and guidance to a learner at a level they can manage, gradually reducing the support as the learner becomes more skilled. This Quranic verse emphasizes the importance of providing appropriate support and not overwhelming others beyond their capabilities, which aligns with the concept of scaffolding in cognitive development where support is tailored to the learners current abilities."
Self-fulfilling prophecy,Social Psychology,"This concept involves expectations about a subject which influence individuals’ behavior towards the subject. It consequently influences the subject to behave according to those expectations, making the ‘prophecy’ come true.",Al-Anfal,8:30,"And [remember, O Muhammad], when those who disbelieved plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you [from Makkah]. But they plan, and Allah plans. And Allah is the best of planners.","This verse from the Quran demonstrates the concept of a self-fulfilling prophecy in the context of the believers and the disbelievers actions towards the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Despite the disbelievers plotting against the Prophet with harmful intentions, Allahs plan ultimately prevails. The disbelievers negative expectations and behaviors did not succeed in their intended outcome due to Allahs ultimate plan. This verse highlights how individuals intentions, expectations, and actions can be overridden by a higher power, emphasizing the importance of trust and reliance on divine will despite the circumstances."
Self-serving bias,Social Psychology,"A common cognitive bias, it involves attributing one’s successes to personal characteristics, while blaming failures on situational factors. This bias nurtures self-esteem but can hinder personal growth and lead to skewed social perception.",Al-Qasas,28:56,"Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided.","This verse reminds us of the concept of self-serving bias by highlighting the importance of attributing success to Allahs guidance rather than solely to personal characteristics. It serves as a humbling reminder that our accomplishments are not solely due to our own abilities, but also the influence of external factors such as fate or divine guidance. By acknowledging Allahs role in our successes, it can help mitigate the tendency to overly attribute success to ones own efforts and foster a sense of humility and gratitude."
Social cognition,Social Psychology,"This refers to how people process, store, and apply information about others and social situations. It involves understanding and predicting others’ behavior and interpreting social cues.",Al-Hujurat (Chapter 49),49:6,"O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful.","This verse from Surah Al-Hujurat highlights the importance of social cognition in the context of verifying information before making judgments about others. It emphasizes the significance of processing, storing, and applying information about others accurately to avoid misunderstandings or harming others due to ignorance. In social cognition, it is crucial to perceive and evaluate social cues correctly, as demonstrated in this verse where believers are advised to investigate and not jump to conclusions based on potentially biased or false information. By understanding and predicting others behavior through thorough investigation and meaningful interpretation of social cues, individuals can avoid harming others unjustly and prevent feelings of regret. This Quranic verse promotes a nuanced understanding of social interactions and the significance of accurate social cognition in maintaining positive relationships and preventing misunderstandings."
Social comparison theory,Social Psychology,Leon Festinger proposed this theory that suggests individuals define themselves through comparison with others to evaluate abilities and opinions. It emphasizes the intrinsic human drive to gain accurate self-evaluations.,Al-Imran,3:110,You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah.,"This verse highlights the importance of social comparison in a positive context. It encourages individuals to strive to be the best version of themselves by comparing their actions and beliefs to the standard set by Allah. By promoting righteousness and prohibiting wrong actions, individuals can evaluate themselves against this ideal standard and work towards self-improvement. This comparison not only helps individuals gain accurate self-evaluations but also serves as a motivation for personal growth and achievement."
Social exchange theory,Social Psychology,"This posits that social behavior results from an exchange process aiming to maximize benefits and minimize costs. Essentially, people assess the worth of an interaction by subtracting the costs from rewards.",Al-Baqarah,2:261,"The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of God is like a seed of grain that sprouts seven ears; in every ear there are a hundred grains. Thus God multiplies the deed of whoever He wills. God is bounteous, all-knowing.","This verse from the Quran highlights the concept of social exchange theory in the context of charitable giving. In social exchange theory, individuals engage in interactions with others based on the expectation of receiving benefits in return, whether tangible or intangible. In this verse, God emphasizes the concept of reciprocity and the rewards of charitable giving. When individuals spend their wealth in the way of God (for the benefit of others), it is likened to a seed that multiplies and brings forth abundant rewards. This can be seen as a form of investment in social relationships where the giver expects benefits in return from God in the form of blessings and rewards. The underlying principle of maximizing benefits and minimizing costs aligns with the idea that acts of kindness and generosity will be rewarded in a magnified manner."
Social facilitation,Social Psychology,"This is a phenomenon where individuals tend to perform simple tasks better when others are present. However, for complex tasks, the presence of others may lead to decreased performance.",Al-Maidah,5:2,"And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression; and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.","This verse from Surah Al-Maidah emphasizes the importance of cooperation in righteousness and piety, which is a key aspect of social facilitation. Individuals may perform better at simple tasks when surrounded by others who are also striving for goodness and righteousness, as the collective encouragement and positive influence can enhance individual performance. However, the verse also cautions against cooperating in sin and aggression, highlighting how the presence of others engaging in negative behaviors can lead to decreased performance, particularly in complex tasks that require higher levels of moral decision-making and cognitive processing. Thus, the concept of social facilitation, where the presence of others can influence individual performance, is reflected in the guidance provided in this Quranic verse regarding cooperation in different contexts."
Social identity theory,Social Psychology,"Proposed by Tajfel and Turner, this theory suggests individual’s self-concept comes from perceived membership in social groups. It explains intergroup behavior, particularly the bias and prejudice perceived between in-group and out-group members.",Al-Hujurat (Chapter 49),13,"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.","This verse from the Quran emphasizes the idea of social identity and group categorization. It highlights that humans are created in various groups and tribes, which reflects the essence of social identity theory proposed by Tajfel and Turner. The verse encourages understanding and accepting diversity among people, stressing that true nobility and superiority come from righteousness rather than superficial markers of group identity. By promoting the idea of knowing one another, the verse calls for breaking down barriers between different groups and fostering inclusivity and tolerance, which aligns with the principles of social identity theory in promoting intergroup harmony and reducing bias and prejudice."
Social loafing,Social Psychology,"This is a behavior where individuals exert less effort when working in a group than when working alone. A common phenomenon, it may foster inefficiency in group projects.",Al-Anfal,8:46,"And obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart; and be patient. Indeed, Allah is with the patient.","This verse emphasizes the importance of unity and effort in working together without disputing or losing courage. Social loafing, where individuals exert less effort in a group setting, may lead to a loss of strength and efficiency, which is warned against in this verse. It indicates that when people work together, they should not let their individual effort decrease, as unity and patience are essential for success."
Stereotyping,Social Psychology,"A cognitive shortcut, it’s the act of attribiting characteristics to a group of people. Stereotypes can be based on race, gender, nationality, occupation, etc., and can often lead to prejudice and discrimination.",Al-Hujurat (49:11),49:11,"O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them; nor let women ridicule [other] women; perhaps they may be better than them. And do not insult one another and do not call each other by [offensive] nicknames. Wretched is the name of disobedience after [ones] faith. And whoever does not repent - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.","This verse from Surah Al-Hujurat addresses the concept of stereotyping and warns against ridiculing or belittling others based on perceived characteristics. It emphasizes the importance of respecting all individuals regardless of their social group or gender, and highlights the negative consequences of engaging in discriminatory behavior. By admonishing believers not to fall into the trap of stereotyping or insulting others, the verse promotes a mindset of tolerance, respect, and empathy towards people from different backgrounds, thereby discouraging prejudice and discrimination."
Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD),Social Psychology,"A central concept in Vygotsky’s theory of cognitive development, the ZPD includes tasks that a learner can’t perform alone but can learn with guidance. It depicts the difference between what a child can do independently and what they can do with assistance.",Al-Ankabut (29:69),"And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good.","And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good.","This verse from the Quran emphasizes the importance of striving and seeking guidance in ones journey towards understanding and learning. In the context of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), the concept of seeking assistance and guidance to reach new levels of understanding can be seen mirrored in this verse. Just as learners in the ZPD require support and guidance to achieve tasks beyond their current capabilities, individuals who strive for Allahs guidance are promised to be guided towards the right path with their efforts and His divine assistance. This highlights the value of mentorship, instruction, and support in both educational and spiritual growth."
Actualizing tendency,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,Humanistic psychologist Carl Rogers proposed this as the inherent motivation present in every life form to develop its potentials to the fullest extent possible. This fundamental construct is considered the primary motivator for all behavior.,91:7-8,"Surah Ash-Shams, 91:7-8",And [by] the soul and Him who proportioned it. And inspired it [with discernment of] its wickedness and its righteousness.,"This verse can be connected to the concept of actualizing tendency as it highlights the essence of the human soul and its inherent inclination towards righteousness. In the Quran, it is emphasized that every individual is endowed with a natural inclination towards goodness and righteousness. This innate motivation to develop ones potentials and strive towards moral excellence resonates with the idea of actualizing tendency proposed by Carl Rogers. The verse implies that humans possess an inner guidance system that directs them towards their fullest potential and encourages them to actualize their virtues."
Autonomy,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"This psychological need refers to a sense of volition and self-endorsed behavior. It’s a core concept of Ryan and Deci’s Self-Determination Theory, promoting well-being and quality performance.",Al-Baqarah,256,There shall be no compulsion in religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong.,"This verse emphasizes the concept of autonomy by highlighting the principle of free will and volition in matters of religion. It stresses that no one should be forced or coerced into belief or action, promoting the idea of individuals having the freedom to choose their path. This aligns with the psychological concept of autonomy, which emphasizes a sense of self-endorsement and volition in decision-making and behavior. Just as this verse affirms the importance of individuals freely choosing their faith, autonomy in psychology emphasizes the importance of individuals feeling in control of their actions and decisions to promote well-being and fulfillment."
Congruence,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"According to Rogers, congruence is the degree of consistency between individuals’ self-perceptions and their experiences in reality. Higher levels of congruence result in a greater sense of comfort and lesser vulnerability.",Al-Araf,7:20,"Then Satan whispered to them to make apparent to them that which was concealed from them of their private parts. He said, Your Lord did not forbid you this tree except that you become angels or become of the immortal.","In this verse, the concept of congruence can be related to the deception and manipulation of Satan. Satan aims to create a discord between what Adam and Eve perceive as prohibited by God and their experiences, leading them to a state of incongruence between their true beliefs and actions. Similarly, in human psychology, incongruence between self-perceptions and reality can lead to inner conflict and discomfort. Striving towards congruence, where ones beliefs, values, and actions align, can lead to a greater sense of alignment and comfort, just as avoiding the whispers of deceit and staying true to ones values is essential in maintaining congruence."
Extrinsic motivation,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"This kind of motivation arises from outside an individual, often involving rewards like money or grades, or consequences like punishment. It’s a significant concept in understanding motivation and facilitates performance on simple tasks.",Al-Qasas,28:77,"But seek, with that (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on you, the Home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of lawful delights in this world; and do good as Allah has been good to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily, Allah likes not the Mufsidun (those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischief-makers, corrupt).","This verse from Surah Al-Qasas emphasizes the balance between worldly pursuits and seeking rewards in the Hereafter. It highlights the importance of not getting solely caught up in material rewards or external motivations but rather keeping in mind the ultimate goal of pleasing Allah and working towards the eternal reward. This relates to the concept of extrinsic motivation where individuals are driven by external rewards or consequences, like money or punishment, to perform certain tasks. The verse encourages individuals to not be solely motivated by earthly rewards but to also consider higher spiritual goals, similar to how extrinsic motivation can drive performance on simple tasks but may not always lead to long-term fulfillment or growth."
Flow state,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi describes flow as the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter. It’s an optimal psychological state leading to high performance and personal satisfaction.,Al-Baqarah,2:45,"And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah].","This verse highlights the importance of focus and dedication in achieving a state of optimal performance and satisfaction. In the context of the concept of flow state, the idea of seeking help through patience and prayer can be understood as a form of mindfulness and concentration during activities. When individuals are fully immersed in their tasks with a humble and submissive attitude, they can reach a state where external distractions fade away, leading to a deep sense of fulfillment and high performance. Just as in the flow state where nothing else seems to matter, dedicating oneself to a task with patience and focus enables the individual to experience a sense of flow and achieve personal satisfaction."
Growth needs vs. deficiency needs,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"In Maslow’s hierarchy, deficiency needs are necessary for survival whereas growth needs are related to psychological development and self-actualization. Unlike deficiency needs, growth needs keep reinforcing even after being satisfied.",Al-Inshirah (Chapter 94),94:6,"Indeed, with hardship comes ease.","This verse acknowledges the fluctuations and balance between deficiency needs and growth needs in human experiences. In times of hardship, individuals often focus on satisfying their deficiency needs such as safety, security, and basic survival requirements, which are crucial for their well-being and stability. However, the Quranic verse also points out that with every hardship or deficiency need, there is an accompanying ease or opportunity for growth and development. This highlights the cyclical nature of human needs - once the deficiency needs are met, individuals have the space and capacity to focus on their growth needs, striving towards self-actualization and fulfillment. Just as Maslows hierarchy suggests, the fulfillment of growth needs continues to motivate individuals even after their deficiency needs are satisfied, emphasizing the importance of pursuing personal development and self-actualization for a meaningful and fulfilling life."
Intrinsic motivation,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"Originates within an individual, driven by interest or enjoyment in the task itself. It’s generally tied to more meaningful learning and creativity, compared to extrinsic motivation.",An-Nahl,97 (16:97),"Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward [in the Hereafter] according to the best of what they used to do.","This verse emphasizes the concept of intrinsic motivation by highlighting the importance of doing righteous deeds purely for the sake of Allah (while he is a believer). When a person is intrinsically motivated to do good deeds, driven by their belief and internal sense of purpose, it leads to a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. The verse also promises a good life in this world and rewards in the Hereafter, which can be seen as the natural outcomes of pursuing tasks with intrinsic motivation. By focusing on the inherent value and enjoyment of righteous deeds, individuals can experience a deeper sense of fulfillment and purpose in their actions."
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"This is a motivation theory proposed by Abraham Maslow, organized in a hierarchy, starting with physiological needs at the base, followed by safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization at the top. According to Maslow, individuals need to meet lower level needs before progressing to higher level ones.",An-Najm,53:39-41,"And that man can have nothing but what he does (good or bad), and that his deeds will be seen (by the angels and then recompensed) will be made clear.","This verse reflects the concept of personal growth and self-actualization as per Maslows hierarchy of needs. It emphasizes the idea that individuals are ultimately responsible for their actions and that they will be held accountable for their deeds. This accountability can serve as a motivator for individuals to strive towards self-improvement and fulfilling their higher-level needs, such as self-actualization, by aligning their actions with positive values and principles. It highlights the importance of personal development and ethical behavior in ones journey towards self-fulfillment."
Mastery,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"The innate desire to become competent and skilled in specific domains. It’s one of Daniel Pink’s elements of intrinsic motivation, central to the individual’s sense of fulfillment and achievement.",Al-Mu’minun (The Believers),23:115,"Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?","This verse brings to light the concept of mastery by emphasizing the purposeful nature of our creation. It encourages individuals to reflect on their existence and highlights the importance of striving for competence and excellence in specific domains as part of fulfilling the purpose for which they were created. Just as mastering skills and achieving competency in various aspects of life contribute to a sense of fulfillment and achievement, this verse serves as a reminder of the significance of utilizing ones talents and abilities to reach their full potential on the path back to the Divine."
Peak experiences,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"Maslow coined this term to describe intense moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, lacking any negative feelings. Self-actualized people are seen as having many such experiences.",Ar-Rad,28:23,"Those who believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured.","In this verse, the concept of finding moments of peace, love, and understanding through the remembrance of Allah is highlighted. Just as Maslow described peak experiences as moments of intense love and happiness, the Quran emphasizes how the remembrance of Allah can bring about a deep sense of assurance and contentment in the hearts of believers. This can be seen as a form of peak experience, where individuals experience a profound connection and positive emotions through their spiritual reflection and mindfulness of the Divine. The verse suggests that turning to Allah in remembrance can lead to transcendent moments of joy and rapture, similar to the concept of peak experiences in humanistic psychology."
Person-centered therapy,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"Developed by Carl Rogers, this non-directive form of talk therapy assumes that clients are the best authorities on their own lives. Therapists offer an accepting and understanding environment where clients can explore their feelings and actions.",Al-Fussilat (41:30),41:30,"Indeed, those who say, Our Lord is Allah and then remain steadfast - the angels descend upon them, [saying], Do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of Paradise, which you were promised.","This verse highlights the concept of providing a supportive and accepting environment for individuals. In person-centered therapy, therapists aim to create a safe space where clients feel accepted and understood. Similarly, in this verse, believers who remain steadfast in their faith are comforted by the angels with words of reassurance and encouragement. The idea of offering solace and glad tidings aligns with the core principle of person-centered therapy, which emphasizes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and fostering a sense of security for individuals to explore their true selves."
Self-actualization,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"The highest level in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, it refers to fulfilling one’s personal potential. It involves the pursuit of authentic identity, purpose, self-awareness, and personal growth.",Al-Isra (Chapter 17),23-24,"Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be kind to parents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in your lifetime, say not to them a word of contempt, nor repel them, but address them in terms of honor. And out of kindness, lower to them the wing of humility, and say, My Lord! Bestow on them Your mercy as they did bring me up when I was small.","This verse emphasizes the importance of honoring ones parents and treating them with kindness and humility. In the context of self-actualization, incorporating the values of respect and gratitude towards ones parents is crucial for personal growth and authentic identity development. By recognizing and fulfilling the duty towards ones parents, an individual can cultivate a sense of purpose, self-awareness, and emotional maturity, contributing to their journey of self-actualization. It highlights the interconnectedness between personal growth and fulfilling relationships with ones parents, reflecting the holistic approach to self-realization advocated in humanistic psychology."
Self-concept,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"This refers to the overall view individuals have of themselves, including beliefs about physical attributes, personality traits, and social roles. According to Rogers, congruence between self-concept and experience promotes positive psychological wellbeing.",Al-Anfal,8:53,That is because Allah would not change a favor which He had bestowed upon a people until they change what is within themselves. (8:53),"This verse highlights the concept of self-concept and personal growth. It emphasizes that a change in oneself is necessary to experience a change in the favors and blessings of Allah. In the context of self-concept, this verse can be understood as the importance of individuals reflecting on their self-perception, beliefs, and behaviors to improve their overall view of themselves. Just as Allah does not change His favor until people change what is within themselves, individuals must also work on aligning their self-concept with their actions and experiences to achieve positive psychological wellbeing. This verse encourages self-reflection, personal growth, and the alignment of ones self-concept with their values and behaviors for a harmonious and fulfilled life."
Self-determination theory,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"Ryan and Deci’s theory suggests humans are motivated by needs for competence, relatedness, and autonomy. It emphasizes intrinsic motivation and psychological needs as essential for well-being and success.",An-Nahl,16:128,Allah is with those who restrain themselves and those who do good.,"This verse from Surah An-Nahl touches upon the concept of self-determination theory, particularly the aspect of autonomy. In the verse, it highlights the importance of self-restraint and doing good, suggesting that individuals have the capacity and responsibility to make their own choices and act in ways that align with moral and ethical values. Self-restraint is a form of self-regulation and autonomy, reflecting the intrinsic motivation to act in accordance with ones beliefs and values for personal growth and well-being. This verse encourages individuals to exercise autonomy in their actions, emphasizing the significance of self-determination in leading a fulfilling and purposeful life."
Unconditional positive regard,Humanist and Motivational Psychology,"Introduced by Rogers, it’s the complete acceptance, love, and acknowledgement from others irrespective of one’s actions. This crucial element of person-centered therapy creates a supportive environment for self-exploration and change.",Al-Imran,159:159,"So by mercy from Allah, [O Muhammad], you were lenient with them. And if you had been rude [in speech] and harsh in heart, they would have disbanded from about you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter.","This verse emphasizes the importance of showing unconditional positive regard towards others, even when faced with difficulties. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is advised to be gentle and kind towards his companions, demonstrating mercy and forgiveness. By extending unconditional positive regard, he creates a supportive and accepting environment, fostering unity and collaboration. This aligns with the concept of providing complete acceptance and love to others irrespective of their actions, as seen in person-centered therapy."
